# BC3997-MuSR-Modified-Murder-Mysteries-Project
Project Repo for BC3997: LLM Foundations &amp; Ethics Final Semester Project! By Kristy Martinez, Umme Raisah, Raul Hinojos

Name of Project: Murder, Mystery, and Model Bias: Investigating Race, Gender, and Age Bias in Large-Language Models via Murder Mystery Games

Our curated dataset hosted on HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kristymrz/BC3997-MuSR-Modified-Murder-Mysteries

This repo contains our evaluation notebook in addition to wrong reasonings for gender, controls, and race. Age is excluded due to file loss and inability (cost limitation) to re-run experiments :-(
