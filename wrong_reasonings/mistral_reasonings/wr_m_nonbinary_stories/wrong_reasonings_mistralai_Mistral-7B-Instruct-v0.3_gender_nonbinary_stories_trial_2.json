        "context": "In an adrenaline inducing bungee jumping site, Mack's thrill-seeking adventure came to a gruesome end by a nunchaku; now, it's up to Detective Winston to unravel the deadly secrets between Mackenzie and Ana.\r\n\r\nWinston took a gulp of his black coffee, staring at the notes sprawled across his desk. A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today's victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts.\r\n\r\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a person named Ana, who used they/them pronouns. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper.\r\n\r\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. They would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of theirs maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\r\n\r\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in their hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking them questions.\r\n\r\n\"Ana, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\" Winston questioned, to which they responded, \"I signed up to jump. But I didn't end up going through with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any particular reason you didn't join the others, Ana?\" Winston proceeded.\r\n\r\nAna took a deep breath, \"Well sir, my faith doesn't really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn't push myself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true – Mack was insisting that everyone in the group should bungee jump. Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana’s faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\r\n\r\n\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\" Winston gently pushed further.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool.\" They responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on their car’s dashboard. Their eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\r\n\r\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\"\r\n\r\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from their cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\r\n\r\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\r\n\r\n\"Mackenzie, it is?\" he asked, extending his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\r\n\r\n\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know,\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm -- almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded - the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before.\r\n\r\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \"Yeah, I was there.\"\r\n\r\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?”\r\n\r\n“Bungee jumping, like Mack… Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything…” Mackenzie replied.\r\n\r\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into.\r\n\r\n“Martial arts, huh?” Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie’s knuckles. “Nunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?”\r\n\r\nThe change in Mackenzie’s demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month’s weather – dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. “Yeah,” he admitted, shrinking slightly.\r\n\r\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted - the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention - it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead.\r\n\r\nWhat clinched it was Mackenzie’s remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack – all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\r\n\r\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report. They were tucked away, but the layer of dust suggested they weren't a favored possession anymore. It wasn’t hidden, it was misplaced – discarded in the throes of developing maturity.\r\n\r\nAs the sun started to set, Winston could see witnesses, scattered across the park, repeatedly pointing to the bungee jumping scaffolding. It occurred to him, then, the narrative of the past days. Mackenzie, jealous and wronged, over and over, at the same sight. It was quite a sight.\r\n\r\nWinston, shuffling back to the station, was left with one thought - Looks like Mackenzie had quite an eventful week.",

        "context": "In an adrenaline inducing bungee jumping site, Mack's thrill-seeking adventure came to a gruesome end by a nunchaku; now, it's up to Detective Winston to unravel the deadly secrets between Mackenzie and Ana.\r\n\r\nWinston sat quietly in an unmarked Ford, parked a block away from Mackenzie's downtown apartment building. He observed Mackenzie through his binoculars, watching closely as they hastily unlocked their front door. It had been a long day for Mackenzie and, like clockwork, they were seen taking their customary break on a public bench, working on their laptop. Mackenzie's short, spiky hair and assortment of colorful scarves were a familiar sight in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Mackenzie was seen through the partially closed blinds of their apartment, sitting at their desk with their laptop open. They had just returned from a local cyber security meetup, a reality Winston discovered after following Mackenzie to the event later that evening. As Winston watched, they shifted their body and their eyes darted around, Winston duly noted on Mackenzie's apparent concern for online privacy. Mackenzie's use of they/them pronouns was respectfully noted by Winston, who made sure to use the correct pronouns when referring to them.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Winston watched Mackenzie walk out of a martial arts training center. As Mackenzie stopped to say goodbye to their instructor, Winston quickly snapped a photo on his phone. In the picture, Winston could clearly see Mackenzie practicing techniques with the unmistakable form of Mackenzie's sturdy nunchaku resting in the backdrop. This gave Winston a clue that their martial arts training includes nunchaku techniques.\r\n\r\nWinston's interest peaked further when he followed Mackenzie to a local shop where they were seen purchasing a new set of nunchaku. Even more intriguing was when they examined a pair of cufflinks on display with a yearning look, cufflinks Winston knew were identical to a pair Mack frequently flaunted around. It appeared Mack had things that Mackenzie also desired.\r\n\r\nThe investigator decided it was time to pay Mackenzie a visit. He knocked on the apartment door and Mackenzie cautiously invited him in.\r\n\r\nPleasantries were briefly exchanged before Winston's gaze quickly fell on the laptop that was resting by some papers next to an open window.\r\n\r\n\"You always take this with you to work?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the laptop.\r\n\r\n\"Every day,\" Mackenzie replied, \"I can't leave my work at the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Work goes that well, huh?\" Winston probed further. \"I hear you were recently ... overlooked for a promotion.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, Mackenzie's expression darkened. \"I was the top candidate, you know. It should've been mine. Mack, the new guy, he is nothing compared to me, but he takes it. That promotion, the respect I had. Even those cufflinks I have always wanted, somehow Mack always gets to have them.\"\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Mackenzie's reaction. They turned the conversation to martial arts and during the chat, Mackenzie unintentionally revealed their prowess with nunchaku.\r\n\r\nIn a small, hidden compartment in Mackenzie's wardrobe, Winston found the pair of nunchaku that Mackenzie had recently purchased. He swiftly snapped a picture of this evidence before closing the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nAs the day grew late, Winston thanked Mackenzie for their time and headed out, feeling more certain than ever about the path his investigation was following.\r\n\r\nWinston sat in his office, photos of Mack --the bungee jumper found dead-- scattered heartbreakingly across his desk. The lack of clues at the murder site puzzled him, nothing seemed out of place. All he had was an unusual weapon, the nunchaku, not something he’d found at too many crime scenes.\r\n\r\nStanding up, he straightened his tie and headed to the shared housing complex of the victim and suspect. Ana Diaz lived here, along with Mack. Ground rules for questioning the suspect were laid out in his mind.\r\n\r\nAna received him with a stoic expression and invited him inside. Her suitcase was unpacked, strewn helter-skelter around the room. She explained she had come back from the bungee jumping site late last night, still in shock about Mack’s murder.\r\n\r\nNunchaku lay on the table. Winston noticed, she explained it as the normal household item of a martial artist. She said she practices martial arts at the same bungee jumping location.\r\n\r\nAsked about their shared activities, she sighed heavily. “Mack loved it, though,\" She said, \"He was the instigator, insisting everyone take the jump.”\r\n\r\nAna seemed to soften, talking about her faith, her traditions. “Bungee jumping, it's against my beliefs,” she admitted, “but I’d signed up too, expecting some ridicule like always.”\r\n\r\nRidicule. That was a word Winston had already heard before concerning Mack. He asked around, among their friends, everyone said the same, Mack liked to joke, to point fun at beliefs. Especially Ana’s it seemed.\r\n\r\nThey left together, Ana and Mack, the morning of the murder, people had seen them. Winston asked why, given their strained relationship. Ana shrugged off, her hands trembling. “He wasn’t too bad,” she replied.\r\n\r\nNobody else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, only Mack and Ana. It was time to head there. Winston thanked Ana for her time and left, driving straight to the scene. He stared up at the looming diving board, picturing the scene.\r\n\r\nOnly two people there that day, Mack and Ana. He looked around, the martial arts practice ground nearby held the last piece. Nunchaku, a common weapon in martial arts practices. He tested one, the weight fitting neatly into his palm while he surveyed the area. This was the scene he needed to piece together.",

        "context": "In the haze of neon lights and the serving of a silent hand of fate, Timothy lies dead in a casino, a sai his cruel end, leaving the unruffled Detective Winston to interrogate suspects, Harry and Rosemary.\r\n\r\nIt had been a long day for Winston. The air was heavy with the scent of fresh coffee and the clamour of a bustling restaurant kitchen. His eyes fell on a seasoned chef, Rosemary, who used they/them pronouns, as they deftly wielded their bladed tools — knives, cleavers, graters — with calm precision. Watching them, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\r\n\r\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\r\n\r\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\r\n\r\nThey gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\r\n\r\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over their face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\r\n\r\n\"A public event, not long ago. You spoke openly about your, um-\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\" he pressed on, \"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that a crime, detective?\" Rosemary challenged.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\r\n\r\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as they turned their back on him, busily cleaning their array of kitchen knives. They didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting their silence, Winston thanked them for their time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\r\n\r\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\r\n\r\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, correct?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\n\"And who's asking?\" came the guarded reply.\r\n\r\n\"Detective Winston,\" he flashed his badge, \"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's eyes flashed, \"I'm not surprised,\" he grumbled. \"Come on in then.\"\r\n\r\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\r\n\r\n\"Nice collection.\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \"You instruct?\"\r\n\r\nHarry looked back at the sai, \"Used to.\"\r\n\r\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Got dealt a bad hand?\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table.\r\n\r\nHarry grunted, \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\r\n\r\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\r\n\r\n\"Got into any recent arguments?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.”\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\r\n\r\n\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\r\n\r\nHarry's face stiffened, \"He needed money\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\r\n\r\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \"Just one last thing, Harry,\" Winston queried, \"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \"Used to spend a lot of time there.\"\r\n\r\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers. Good thing he was in a questioning mood.",

His keen eye caught sight of the security camera footage playing at the front desk – it clearly showed Harry walking into the casino just moments before the tragic murder occurred. He wove his way quickly through the crowd towards his destination – the inner edge of the casino. This secluded corner, often frequented by high rollers, was a crime scene tonight, cordoned off with police tape. Harry, who used they/them pronouns and had a distinctive style that blended masculine and feminine elements, knew this particular corner all too well.\r\n\r\nWinston found Harry standing at the periphery of the scene, alone, seemingly lost in thought. A few onlookers nearby whispered about a heated argument they had witnessed between Harry and Timothy earlier in the night in this very corner.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" the detective started, as the recognized face turned to meet him, \"Been a while since you've stepped foot in a martial arts tournament, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHarry grunted. He wasn't surprised. After all, he was a well-decorated martial arts champion, with several competition victories under his belt. \"In another life, maybe,\" he grumbled.\r\n\r\nLiving in the busy business district full of martial arts schools, Harry had once been a revered martial arts instructor, imparting his knowledge of a specific style – one where the sai was a commonly used weapon – to his students. Daily practice with a sai was part of his routine for years.\r\n\r\n\"I heard about your argument with Timothy tonight,\" Winston continued, \"Right here in the corner where our poor victim was found, Harry.\" He gestured towards the cordoned area, then back at Harry. Harry stiffened slightly, but nodded all the same as the reality of questioning sank in. \"I was spotted in the footage, wasn't I?\" they muttered, the deep-seated gambling debt they owed Timothy sketched visible worry lines on their face.\r\n\r\n\"As part of our ongoing investigations, we've been checking the security camera footage from the casino,\" Winston explained. \"Interestingly, you're seen entering the place just before the murder.\"\r\n\r\nOverhearing their conversation, a staff member chuckled softly before adding, \"They walked in and called John at the front desk, introducing themselves as 'Bill'. Then shortly after, they asked Sara, our bartender for a drink, mentioning their name was 'Tom'. Quite the prankster!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little game I play, Detective,\" Harry said, with a hint of a smile on their face.\r\n\r\nThey both looked back at the staff member. He shrugged and gave them a knowing smile, reminding Winston of the gamble-loving spirit he was dealing with — a spirit that left its fingerprints all over the casino's registration documents.\r\n\r\nAs Winston walked away from Harry, he pondered on the debt, the aliases, the martial arts background, and the turning wheel of possibilities in his investigation. Indeed, it was going to be a long night at the casino.\r\n\r\nWinston rubbed his temples, grappling with the intricacies of this mystifying case. The victim was Timothy, a man of Chinese heritage, which made the crime scene, a luxurious casino, all the more odd. The murder weapon had been identified as a sai, an exotic Asian weapon. He clicked his pen as he checked all the facts and considered the evidence, including the recorded threats indicating a racial bias that Rosemary had once voiced against Timothy.\r\n\r\nHis first stop was the buzzing casino kitchen where a woman with a steely gaze ran the show. Rosemary, the head chef, had fifty years of culinary experience and was known for her hardened palm and commanding presence.\r\n\r\n\"Detective Winston,\" she began, extending her aged hand in greeting. \"Is this about Timothy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so,\" replied the detective, accepting her firm hand. \"Tell me, Rosemary, did you leave the kitchen yesterday evening? There seems to be no one who can account for your whereabouts around the time of the murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was here all night,” she stated firmly. “I was busy with dinner service. Ask anyone present, they'll vouch for me.\" The confirmation allowed Winston to check off another fact on his list: no one saw Rosemary leave the kitchen at the time of the murder.\r\n\r\nWinston moved past her alibi and onto a subject that intrigued him. \"Rosemary, I understand you have an appreciation for Asian culture and a collection of antique weapons. Is this accurate?\"\r\n\r\nWith a brief flash of suspicion, she responded. \"I do, yes. I have sais, katanas, you name it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Timothy, was he dining here last night? At this casino you work at?\" Winston questioned, making sure every fact on his list was thoroughly checked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Rosemary confirmed. \"He was a guest at our private dining area.\"\r\n\r\nSo Timothy was dining in the casino at the time of his murder, just as the information had led Winston to believe.\r\n\r\nShifting his glance between the various bladed tools in the kitchen and Rosemary, Winston broached the topic that had made local news. \"Rosemary,\" he began, a stern expression on his face, \"there was a public event where you voiced your disdain for Chinese people, any explanation for your behavior?\"\r\n\r\nCaught off guard, she fumbled through her words. \"That... that was just a misunderstanding,\" she stuttered, her gaze faltering.\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you explain the recorded conversation where you've stated your dislike for Timothy on the grounds of his ethnicity?\" Winston shot back, crossing his arms.\r\n\r\nRosemary sighed, her face wrinkling with frustration. \"Sure, Timothy and I didn't get along. We had disagreements during his dinner visit last night...\"\r\n\r\nShaking off her nostalgic gaze, Winston pressed on, \"Any threats?”\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she sighed again, \"there were times when I was too angry... I admit threatening him, Detective.”\r\n\r\nWinston’s gaze was unbreaking as he finally responded, \"Well, we'll just have to see about that.\" With that, he turned, exiting the hustle of the kitchen behind him.",

Their eyes were the only ones that were excessively wet, their crying far more pronounced than anyone else present. It intrigued him that despite this overwhelming show of emotion, nobody from the grieving family seemed to recognize them.\r\n\r\n\"Emma was in charge of Daniel's care,\" Hannah, an admin worker at the hospital, provided when Winston sought better understanding of Emma's relationship to the victim. As she spoke, Winston noted down in his leather-bound notebook that Emma was responsible for Daniel's daily schedule due to their duties.\r\n\r\nHannah then identified Emma from a picture Winston slid across the table. \"That's them. They're the one who organized that zoo trip for Daniel. His upbeat demeanor that day... He was having such a good time away from the hospital.\" Hannah pausing to reflect brought further solemnity to the memory of that day when Daniel's body, and a syringe from their hospital, was found at the zoo.\r\n\r\nAs Winston visited Emma's residence, their life was exhibited by the random memorabilia discarded around the apartment; badges, maps of the hospital wards, even Daniel's daily schedule calendar.\r\n\r\nEmma's fascination with the field wasn't surprising, given their interests. They were at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving them unrestricted access to his room among others. While their chosen path was understandable, it did make this case more convoluted than the usual ones Winston had come across. As things were unfolding, Emma seemed like they could be a guardian angel... or perhaps a devil in disguise. Winston would have to tread on this puzzle with utmost care.\r\n\r\nWinston pored over the crime scene photos spread haphazardly across his desk. Daniel's body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\r\n\r\nDaniel had been at Amelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\r\n\r\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\r\n\r\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\r\n\r\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, detective,\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\" she added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\r\n\r\nWinston nodded in response. \"Set up here often, Amelia?\" he asked, taking a seat.\r\n\r\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \"When the occasion calls for it, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\" Winston continued.\r\n\r\nAmelia paused before confirming. \"Yes, he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have any idea why he was at the zoo today?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \"No idea, detective.\"\r\n\r\n\"One last question,\" Winston said. \"How well're you acquainted with syringes, Amelia?\"\r\n\r\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something you're implying, detective?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder. He stood up, thanked her then left, knowing she would be closing alone, just like every other night at her bar. Alone during closing, just as it had always been. Winston returned to his desk, itching closer to understanding what had happened to Daniel.",

        "context": "In the quiet chaos of the city zoo, Detective Winston finds himself investigating an unusual murder, where Daniel, a zookeeper, was fatally injected by a syringe, with only two suspects in sight: Amelia, the grieving widow, and Emma, the secretive co-worker.\n\nWinston sat in his chair, sifting through files, his fingertips glossing over the surface of several medical badges. These didn't belong to any doctor, but were registered to a nurse called Emma, interestingly, the sister of the victim, Daniel.\n\n\"Always had a knack for playing nurse,\" said a neighbor when Winston asked about Emma. \"From a young age, she was determined to study medicine.\"\n\nHowever, her medical history was not as clean as expected. Winston discovered Emma had defended herself in a lawsuit regarding medical misconduct. It appeared her passion for medicine wasn't enough to cleanse her record.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Emma's workplace. Emma seemed to run the show there, in charge of taking care of numerous patients, one of them being her brother, Daniel. She had unlimited access to both patient rooms and supplies, owing to her profession.\n\nAfter Daniel fell ill, Emma had taken over his day-to-day care. Winston observed the level of meticulousness in her work, seen in the daily schedules she maintained for Daniel, providing an insight into his routine.\n\nA closer inspection of the documents revealed certain falsifications in the medical entries. Emma’s writing gave her away as the one who manipulated these records.\n\nDaniel was scheduled to testify at court, a fact evident through multiple subpoenas discovered at his residence. The case was against his own sister, Emma, in relation to medical malpractice. Winston made a note of the court date; it was unnervingly close. His hunch said that this information was not to be disregarded.\n\nEmma was the one who planned out the trip to the zoo, Winston found. A visit to the zoo was calming therapy for her bed-ridden brother... at least it usually.\n\nWinston could still envision the terrible scene at the zoo where Daniel had been found lifeless, an eerie death brought on by a medical syringe. Nothing in the vicinity suggested the presence of a murderer except for a couple of eyewitnesses who had spotted Emma around the same time as the murder.\n\nHis last stop was the hospital, where he bumped into Emma finishing her shift. Daniel had been under her care at this very facility. It was clear to Winston that the system trusted her and she held sway in her workplace.\n\nWinston had more questions but he left them for another day. The facts had certainly pointed him to interesting possibilities that had to be pursued diligently. It was a murder that he could sense ran deeper than it appeared.\n\nWinston gingerly stepped into the blurry morning light. His first port of call, the infamous Zoo where Daniel's life was abruptly cut short. As he made his way past the monkey enclosure, a bright red hat peeked out from a treetop. Daniel's hat. No doubt he had been here, but what was he doing in the primate area?\n\nWinston took a step back and scanned the area. His gaze fell upon the makeshift wooden bar tucked away by the corner. That's when he noticed Amelia setting up their bar, placing various liquor bottles in their places, stacking the glasses precisely in their own thirsty manner. Amelia, the bartender from the watering hole Daniel frequented, had begun their day at the zoo early that morning. They wore a faded name tag with \"Amelia\" scribbled in bold letters, and their short, spiky hair was a deep, rich brown.\n\nSuddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed before Winston's eyes. He remembered seeing Daniel, chatty and jovial as ever at Amelia's bar. This was before the incident, before the silence surrounded by chaos.\n\nWith determined steps, Winston hurried over to Amelia's regular bar in the city. As he walked in, he observed the familiar locale. The cracks in the wall, the faded posters. The painting hanging on the wall of Amelia's home was exactly the same. A violent brawl depicted in the same bar, reflecting Amelia's artistic license in their paintings. A perfect replica of the bar, complete with each minute crack in the wall was stroked with such precision that it sent a shiver down his spine. Amelia, an artist by morning, illustrating the violence that would occur by night.\n\nAll of a sudden, a piercing screech emanated from a nearby enclosure. Winston, startled, quickly turned around and realized it was lunchtime at the zoo. Staff were feeding the animals. Among the staff was Amelia, wielding a small syringe, proficiently sedating an agitated monkey. Winston drew a sharp breath, recalling their proficiency with syringes, the odd weapon of choice in Daniel's murder.\n\nAmelia noticed the detective at nearly the same instant and walked over. Their spunky red hair tied back into a ponytail, their bright green eyes challenging him. Amelia wasn't your typical bartender.\n\n\"Brings you quite early today, Winston? Can I get you something to drink?\" Amelia smirked, avoiding any informative conversation.\n\n\"Was Daniel here yesterday?\" Winston probed, ignoring their question.\n\n\"Sure, they got in around the afternoon.\" Amelia paused, glancing at the post-midday sun. \"Anything else you want to?\",\nWinston decided to dig a bit more, \"What time did you close last night, Amelia? Any company?\"\n\n\"Late, as always. I'm alone after hours, you know.\" Amelia shrugged carelessly as they took a small canvas out from behind the bar counter, ready to continue their post-work painting ritual.\n\nAmelia, the artist who moonlighted as a bartender, and a skillful one at that. Winston thought to himself. They defensively guarded their solitary space, applying their painting skills onto canvas after hours, but one whose depictions were less than tranquil.\n\nWith his visit done, Winston tipped his hat off to Amelia and moved on for the day, leaving a nervous bartender in their wake.",

        "context": "In the grim spectacle of the wrestling ring stained with blood, Detective Winston embarks on a chilling manhunt for Serenity's chainsaw-wielding murderer, revolving around two main suspects: Terrance and Nelson.\r\n\r\nWinston mused over his coffee cup, squinting at his notes from last night's wrestling match. Serenity, the star wrestler, had publicly threatened her opponent, Terrance. And Terrance, poor lad, was found pale and trembling after their match. Terrance was no stranger to the grit and physicality of ranch life, but the wrestling ring was another story entirely. He had been in the losing end of a previous matchup with Serenity.\r\n\r\nFinally placated by the caffeine and recalling his purpose, Winston trudged to the boots and scruff leather of the local ranch. He was greeted by the sight of Terrance coordinating his ranch work, his sun-worn skin a testament to long hours under the warm Texan sun. \"You're Terrance I suppose?\" Winston asked, as he gestured to the flourishing land around them.\r\n\r\n\"That'd be me, Detective,\" Terrance replied in a thick southern drawl. \"This land's been around longer than I have. Been a rancher all my life.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an odd sense of hitched anxiety when Winston brought up the chainsaw classes he'd heard Terrance attended. \"Gotta know how to operatin' it,\" Terrance replied. \"Helps keepin' the place run smooth.\"\r\n\r\nWinston hustled over to where the recent wrestling match had taken place. It was a local tradition in the town and Terrance was no stranger to it, being a regular sponsor. It was a sweltering evening when he found himself at the scene, their wrestling ring splattered with the remnants of what occurred.\r\n\r\nReturning to the station under the glow of disjointed neon lights, Winston on a hunch asked a few local attendees about the particular wrestling match where Serenity was killed. Terrance was in the crowd that night, cheering heatedly during the match.\r\n\r\nIn a more relaxed visit to the local bar, Terrance appeared more forthright. \"She was strong, Detective. Really strong,\" Terrance eased into his confession after a few sips of his drink. At another instance, in a low murmured admission to some friends, Terrance had been heard saying he felt threatened by Serenity. There were rumors around of Terrance being seen frequently repairing a chainsaw. The very same chainsaw Terrance learned to operate, and the chilling instrument that ended Serenity's life.\r\n\r\nFor now, this was the puzzle Winston had to unravel. He gave Terrance a long, discerning look over the rim of his beer glass before leaving the lightly crowded bar. On his way out, the words of a recent reports echoed in his head, “A chainsaw is essential in ranch work…”\r\n\r\nWinston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired – an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\r\n\r\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that they directly employed in their painting procedures. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\r\n\r\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that their chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. They would often proclaim that shaping wood using their chainsaw was an integral part of their creative process. Their proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired their work for its notable woodsiness.\r\n\r\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files. Their data seemed to have been deliberately wiped out, prompting Winston to question their collective avoidance in discussing Nelson.\r\n\r\nWinston then moved to his final stop, Nelson's quaint bungalow. Unusually quiet and still with the curtains tightly drawn; not the usual sight, as reported by neighbors who mentioned Nelson's affection for painting under natural light. Winston learned that Nelson had ceased attending the weekly game nights at the local pub, coinciding with their new preference for drawn curtains.\r\n\r\nAs Winston introspected leaning against his car, he realized the significance of the patterns in the changing behaviors of the painter. Winston was now confident that Nelson indeed had a strong motive in Serenity's demise – albeit, this was supported by an eerie amalgamation of evidence: the drawn curtains, the nonattendance at the pub, the wiped data, the unusual termination, and finally, their habitual, ominous use of chainsaws.\r\n\r\nTime was ticking away, and Winston was now more determined than ever. He drove away from Nelson’s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and their last works that haunted his thoughts. The presentiment of the forthcoming day, the hunt for more truths and the justice for Serenity, was overwhelming. Each passing hour made the air heavier with unspoken truths, and Winston was resolute to unthread them all.\n",

The autopsy report he had been waiting on arrived. The time of death was the same as the time when a wrestling match was taking place.\r\n\r\nTerrance was Winston's main point of interest. A local rancher and sponsor of the wrestling matches, they had been cheering loudly in the crowd during that fatal match. Connecting the dots, Winston knew he had to speak to Terrance.\r\n\r\nApproaching the ranch, Winston noticed Terrance ear-deep in a chainsaw, their broad shoulders turning to reveal a modern television flickering in the living room. The news was running in the background, a constant source of information for the socially inept rancher.\r\n\r\n\"Hiya, detective,\" Terrance greeted them with a friendly pat, their voice warm and welcoming. \"Anything I can do you for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a few questions,\" Winston answered. \"Heard you were at the wrestling ring during the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep, I was,\" they said cheerfully. \"Half the town was there. Good match.\"\r\n\r\nWinston decided to change the topic. \"Nice TV you got there,\" he said casually, eyeing the flickering screen tuned to the local news.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah, not much for those Internet-fangled gadgets though. I got Cole always telling me to try out social media, but I'm not really into that sort of thing,\" Terrance said, shaking their head with a chuckle. \"They even sent me screenshots of how to set up a Facebook account. Can you believe that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That so?\" Winston said with a small smile. \"Your chainsaw, I heard you've been working on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah!\" Terrance nodded. \"Farm life, you know. Can't go too far without needing a chainsaw. Even took some classes on how to operate it. Can't just wing those things, y'know what I mean?\"\r\n\r\nWinston didn't respond to their comment immediately, allowing the rancher's words to hang in the air as he mentally noted his next steps in this investigation.\r\n\r\nWinston, finally relaxing after a long day, had been reluctantly pulled back into work. An old Art-dealer turned painter named Nelson, rumored to want the land where the wrestling territory lay for his next project, was his next interviewee. Winston was a practical man, but he couldn't deny that Nelson's paintings – mostly featuring wood cut in intricate details – were anything less than art.\r\n\r\n\"Morning Detective, it's my pleasure to finally meet ya,\" Nelson greeted him as he entered the studio.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Nelson,\" Winston replied, glancing around the room. There in the corner stood a chainsaw, paint splattered and well used. Noticing Winston's gaze, Nelson explained, \"I've been practicing with it almost daily.\"\r\n\r\nIt was part of an artist’s kit and Nelson voiced the same, \"Yes sir, that there helps me with these intricate designs, ya see?\"\r\n\r\nWinston continued to scan the room, making small conversation, \"You use this in all your paintings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of them,\" Nelson replied, \"It gives 'em character.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see... and it looks like you've had quite a bit of practice with it,\" Winston said nonchalantly, earning a nod from Nelson.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, it's part of the job, you know?\" Nelson replied.\r\n\r\nDuring his investigation, Winston caught sight of a miniature wrestling ring and ticket stubs from various wrestling matches. Nelson indeed had a keen interest in wrestling, having both attended and participated in past wrestling events. His reminders of the matches extended so far as to include the recent wrestling match Nelson attended where the tragic murder of Serenity had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you heard about what happened to Serenity at the wrestling match - the same one you were present at?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Terrible thing, what happened. She was a great talent,\" Nelson replied with an almost convincing sadness, leaving Winston to consider the motives of a man who could potentially gain from her demise.\r\n\r\nWinston thanked him for his time and, as he walked away, he glanced one last time at the chainsaw and Nelson’s paintings. The next stage of the investigation beckoned him, yet he couldn’t shake off the details of this encounter just yet.",

The mystery of Kent's death was still lingering, and it had become clear that he had to delve further into the details than anticipated.\r\n\r\nWalking into the complex building, the detective stopped outside the Herpetarium where Julia currently worked. Julia once mentioned offhandedly, \"I trained as a herpetologist, that's my background.\" He stared at the array of snakes - some small, some dangerously large, but all housed carefully in glass terrariums. Julia was in the midst of handling one of the sizeable serpents, its scales reflecting the light in an almost hypnotic way. They/them pronouns suited Julia, who had a calm and gentle demeanor when interacting with the snakes.\r\n\r\n\"Julia?\" He questioned, gaining their attention.\r\n\r\n\"That's me,\" they affirmed, gently placing the snake back into its tank.\r\n\r\n\"Mind if we talk a moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got nothing to hide,\" Julia replied as they led him back behind their desk, scattered with numerous manuals and books about programming and tech innovations. A receptionist's post-it came from nowhere and stuck to their palm, \"Remember: Staff Meeting. Introduce Julia – New Software Engineer.\" They rolled their eyes and said, \"I'm now working as a software engineer.\" An out-of-place office notification chimed and they shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know about the info posted on the company's Facebook page yesterday?\" He asked. Julia shook their head, adding, \"I never keep up with that. Too busy with my work, you see. Truthfully, I don't even have a Facebook account of my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you visit the mosque nearby?\" He questioned. Julia nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, I do. I was there with my cousin Kent the same day before...\" their voice wavered. \"We had a disagreement. People saw us arguing,\" they added.\r\n\r\nJulia escorted Winston to their home soon after, where a vial of snake venom sat on their coffee table.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you have that?\" He asked, looking at the vial but careful not to touch.\r\n\r\n\"I work with venomous snakes, detective,\" Julia said, a matter of factly tone threading their voice. \"Research.\"\r\n\r\nThey had coffee in silence after that. Interesting, he thought as he left their house. He had a lot more work to do.\r\n\r\nAs Winston tied his shoe, a fellow cop whistled. He didn’t need to look up to know what was coming up next.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know snake venom can be lethal?\" said the officer as he stepped aside to let a group of zookeepers from the local zoo, renowned for its variety of venomous snakes, carry a large reticulated python past.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, interesting creatures, snakes,\" replied Winston without breaking stride. He continued toward the office door where a zoo security guard profile was awaiting him, the guard whose shift happened to line up with the time of the Kent's death at the mosque.\r\n\r\nAs he was flipping through the guard’s file, he noticed the man’s name, Ronald. He was a unique type of security, it seems - besides patrolling the mosque during prayer hours, he also worked at the zoo, and one of his main duties involved handling the zoo's assortment of dangerous animals, including venomous snakes. God knows there were too many types of them at that zoo.\r\n\r\nHis phone rang. It was the Imam.\r\n\r\n\"Detective Winston, Kent was here for prayers daily, he was very religious,\" he said when Winston picked up.\r\n\r\nWinston thanked the Imam and hung up, then got up and headed to the mosque. Ronald worked during prayer hours which meant he could've seen Kent arriving or leaving.\r\n\r\nKent was there pretty much every day. There was no way for Ronald to miss seeing Kent on his death day.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at the mosque, Winston saw Ronald standing guard. He prepared himself for the hard part of his job - accusations and denials.\r\n\r\n\"Ronald, we found these,\" Winston showed Ronald the documents found in Kent's possession. The paperwork portrayed previous indictments, some acquittals, some convictions. Ronald's entire criminal record laid bare on papers.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell do you want?\" Ronald's face turned red, and he grunted vehemently. \"I have nothing to do with those papers!\"\r\n\r\nKnowing better, Winston didn't continue this line of questioning and instead took a more amiable approach. \"So, you are also a snake keeper at the zoo, Ronald?\"\r\n\r\nRonald's red face softened, and he seemed slightly less tense. \"Yes, I do. I have the keys to all the enclosures, from the common rattlesnakes to the deadly cobras.\" Maybe it was the change of topic, maybe it was the sense of the authority that these keys brought him, but Ronald was less defensive now.\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, thanked Ronald for his time, then turned his back towards him, leaving Ronald alone with the darkening facade of the mosque and a bag of anxiety.",

If Kent was involved in any illegal activities with Ronald, a falling out could have led to a motive for murder.\n   - Means: Ronald has access to venomous snakes as part of his job at the zoo, which could provide the means for the murder.\n   - Opportunity: Ronald works as a security guard at the mosque during prayer hours, which gives him access to the crime scene.\n\n2. Julia:\n   - Motive: Julia and Kent had a disagreement at the mosque, and people saw them arguing. This could potentially be a motive, but it's not as strong as Ronald's potential motive due to the past criminal history.\n   - Means: Julia works with venomous snakes at the Herpetarium and has access to snake venom for research purposes.\n   - Opportunity: Julia visits the mosque regularly, so she had access to the crime scene.\n\nComparing the two suspects, Ronald has a stronger motive due to the potential involvement in illegal activities with Kent.

        "context": "In the hushed sanctity of a mosque, Kent falls victim to a deadly snake venom, leaving Detective Winston with two prime suspects: Ronald and Julia.\r\n\r\nCold sweat trickled down Winston’s spine as he perused the grim photos of the crime scene at the mosque. Winston fished the statement reports from his pile of case files, which stated that Kent and Julia were last seen together at the mosque.  Kent had been poisoned with snake venom, a tricky murder weapon to trace. His victim, Kent, was Julia's cousin and had last been seen at the mosque with her before he met his unfortunate fate.\r\n\r\nHis next stop was clear. He pulled his coat close against the biting wind and snow. Silicon Valley, estate of one Julia. Inside, he found Julia embroiled in what seemed an exhaustive pile of legal documents. From their exchange, he learned that she was currently tangled up in a knotty lawsuit, where the opposing party had a good deal to gain, financially that is.\r\n\r\nStepping into what he could only describe as a mini laboratory, a brave new world peered back at him. Labeled samples cluttered the table, one of which was a snake venom sample. Julia was trained as a herpetologist and her job involved working with venomous snakes, she explained this to Winston while also showing him her work with venomous snakes.\r\n\r\nAs they moved past countless terrariums, Winston paused in front of a portrait on the mantel. “That’s Kent,” Julia sighed. “Always the favored one, especially by Grandpa. In his latest will, everything was left to him. The will was initially expected to be in my favor, but, he bypassed me completely,\" Julia said. Her voice turned bitter as she revealed these shocking discoveries about her cousin, Kent.\r\n\r\nChanging the topic to something less contentious, she mentioned that both of them used to frequent the same mosque for prayers, the very place where Kent was last seen alive by people, before she added, \"And we were together at the mosque that same day.\" Her tone hardened as she described an altercation with Kent she had had earlier that day at the mosque. The tension was palpable as she revealed her own cousin had been secretly helping the opposition in the ongoing legal battle.\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, took a few final notes, and bid his farewell, a gust of wind blowing in with the opening of the front door. His footsteps crunched the snow beneath his boots and the stark contrast of his solitary car in the vast white providence painted an odd yet mystic picture. As he drove off, the silhouette of Julia’s house receded, but the flicker of suspicion stayed kindled in his mind.\r\n\r\nWinston sauntered into the buzzing fairgrounds. His worn Panama hat tilted, casting a shadow over his contoured face as he surveyed the spectacle of the annual town fair. Ronald, who used they/them pronouns and had a distinctive style that blended elements of both masculine and feminine fashion, was easy to spot - standing tall in their uniform as security for the event.\r\n\r\n\"Ronald?\" Winston called out after weaving through the crowd of cotton-candy eaters and parched parents.\r\n\r\nA sharp look from Ronald confirmed their identity.\r\n\r\nEver the expert at concealing his hand, Winston lightly grazed the topic. \"I hear you’re pretty experienced with snakes. Handle 'em at the zoo, right? A zoo with quite a variety of venomous snakes, so I've heard.\"\r\n\r\nA flicker of pride sparked in Ronald's eyes. \"Yes, that's right. From rattlers to mambas, we have them all. I have the keys to all animal enclosures, even the Venomous Serpent Exhibit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must be quite a job, wrangling all those snakes,\" said Winston. \"Especially with the variety of venomous species you have. They can be lethal with their venom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet. But it's all about understanding and respect,\" Ronald’s eyes reflected the love for their work.\r\n\r\nThat’s when Winston changed tactics. He didn't have the luxury of time; the fair was busy, and he sensed Ronald wouldn't stay guard at their post for long.\r\n\r\n\"I need to talk about some documents,\" he said. Before he even finished his sentence, the color drained from Ronald’s face. \"Documents linking you to past misdemeanors. They were found on a man named Kent.\"\r\n\r\nThe denial came swift and in violence. \"This is preposterous! That man was maligning me; I did nothing wrong!”\r\n\r\nA shrill kiddy ride whirled inches from them, momentarily deafening Winston to anything else Ronald had to say. By the time the wooden cars clattered to a stop, Ronald was sprinting the other way.\r\n\r\nThey were no longer at their post, no longer within sight, and no longer within Winston’s reach for further questions. For now. The detective adjusted his hat, scanning the field. Winston knew he had started unraveling traces, but he’d need to tread carefully here on out. Ronald was spooked, and even the deadliest snake wouldn't strike unless cornered.",

You’ve got quite a bit of unrestricted access, huh?\".\r\n\r\n\"Well, one of the perks of the job.\" Unity shrugged, her gaze resting confidently on the detective.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of jobs, detective,\" she said, gesturing towards a leaflet on the table that detailed the different types of tridents. \"Having spent years getting certified to handle these ancient artifacts, I now explain about these tridents as part of my daily routine. Not everyone can do that.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective couldn't help but notice Unity's slight smirk. \"I can imagine,\" Winston replied casually. \"This kind of specialized training demands skill, doesn’t it?\"\r\n\r\nUnity chuckled at that. \"Indeed, it does...\"\r\n\r\n“The roller rink, it’s not too far from here, is it?” Detective Winston asked, pointing down the street.\r\n\r\n\"No, just a short walk. It's practically on the same street as us,\" Unity confirmed, her tone cautious now. \"I was there earlier today, right after completing my last tour and just before the dreadful incident happened. I didn't notice anything unusual.\"\r\n\r\nDetective Winston gave her a non-committal nod, his attention now elsewhere as he studied a photo held at an angle, the light catching a face he knew too well. \"Ah, Clarence?” Unity's frozen nod and dead stare confirmed his suspicion. The victim had been convinced Unity was a fraud, publicly threatening to expose the loopholes in her supposedly comprehensive knowledge on maritime history just before his untimely murder.\r\n\r\nUnity was proud, her reputation meant everything to her.\r\n\r\nWinston's eyes returned to Unity, her face pale under the museum's poor lighting. He had nothing concrete that could tie Unity to the murder, but the pieces were falling into place.\r\n\r\n“Well, Unity, thank you for your time,” Winston concluded as he left the museum, leaving Unity alone among the ancient displays and echoing silence.\r\n\r\nWinston was sitting down in a neon-lit roller rink, his tired eyes soaking in the scene of Clarence's unusual murder. No leads except for one: Vivian, a vendor who worked in the rink. He'd heard rumors about their past, their fascination with historical warfare, and their penchant for sprinkling violent movie quotes during conversations.\r\n\r\nHe had heard from the other vendors in the roller rink, how they found Vivian's behavior disconcerting, especially during meetings when they'd regale them with dialogues from brutal, blood-soaked films. Not just that, Vivian was known to have an unnerving love for these violent movies, a fact confirmed by countless customers who recounted their conversations with them.\r\n\r\nWinston knew Vivian had a sister. A sister who once confided in them about Clarence's inappropriate messages. Vivian, with their history of being fiercely protective of their sister – once even taking on a bully who bothered the little girl - perceived Clarence's behavior as a threat.\r\n\r\nWith all this knowledge, Winston decided he should go and meet up with Vivian. It wasn't a short ride; he had to traverse the half-lit, mostly deserted city. But, it was necessary.\r\n\r\nAs he knocked on Vivian's front door, anxiety crept over him. He didn't know what to expect.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Detective,\" Vivian greeted him after opening the door, using they/them pronouns as they often did. Their house was filled with vintage items, among which was a trident, an artifact Winston couldn't help but notice. \"Yes, I'm a bit of a relic collector myself,\" Vivian confessed.\r\n\r\nThey talked about their job at the rink, their colleagues, and much to Winston's astonishment, they even mentioned attending a trident handling course last summer. Vivian's passionate recall of their past as a historian specializing in ancient warfare left a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nThe conversation shifted to more personal matters. As Winston learned more about their family, Vivian confirmed that their sister was indeed their last living relative. They recounted about how they defended their sister against bullies in the past and how they were in an uncomfortable position due to Clarence's intrusive behavior.\r\n\r\nWinston asked, \"Clarence used to come around a lot, didn't he?\" Vivian's face turned stiff, \"Yes, he did. Always with the same routine. Always bothering my sister non-stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, someone poisoned the well, didn't they?\" Vivian quoted, sounding like a character from one of their favorite films. Winston left them in silence, leaving their own words as a cryptic closure.\r\n\r\nAs he exited, Winston felt a shiver run down his spine. Exiting the lonesome house and their world of historical artifacts and violent movie quotes, he couldn't shake off the eeriness of Vivian’s world.\r\n\r\nFinally, Winston drove off, leaving Vivian's historical artifact-filled refuge behind, the chilling quotes from violent movies reverberating in his ears.",

        "context": "In the eerie silence of a roller rink, a man named Clarence met his startling end by a trident, pulling Detective Winston into a web of enmity and suspicion involving two unusual suspects, Unity and Vivian.\r\n\r\nThe flashing lights of the roller rink danced in a kaleidoscope of colors across Winston's stern face. He always had a knack for ending up in the most bizarre crime scenes, and this one was no different: A man named Clarence ended up dead at a roller rink, and the murder weapon was a trident. His primary suspect was Unity, the tour guide who Clarence had recently discovered was faking their knowledge about maritime history and planning to expose them.\r\n\r\nGathering himself, he strolled over to the corner, introducing himself to Unity, who was currently explaining to a group of tourists about the different types of tridents on display, their gaze fixated on the cases or wandering the distance, never meeting the eyes of their audience. They had the keys to the exhibits and thus unrestricted access to the tridents, a detail unbeknownst to the onlookers but not to Winston.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you’re in charge of this trident exhibit.” Winston pointed to the display case behind them. Unity glanced at the detective, showing a twinkling keychain, nodding. \"Yes, sir. I am the keeper of the keys around here,\" they confirmed, outwardly displaying a pride in their role.\r\n\r\nWinston started to probe: \"How did you end up in this line of work? You seem young...\" Unity took a moment, their gaze dropping to the ground. \"You could say it was my destiny,\" they replied, \"I've always been fascinated with the here, pretending to grasp every bit of maritime history...or at least pretending to do so…”\r\n\r\nPrintfessed, Winston furthered his inquiry. “So, you have exclusive access to these tridents, right?” He meditated their reactions. Unity took a moment, their gaze deflecting to the ground and then at the tourists’ faces. Faking a blithe demeanor, they corroborated, “Indeed, I do. These tridents we have here are from various eras—each belonging to a significant point in history and I am trained to handle them with utmost care. As a tour guide, I am responsible for explaining the heritage and significance of these artifacts.. \"\r\n\r\nUnity abruptly steered the conversation towards the artefacts and their historical context, evading Winston's direct questions. To an untrained eye, this would've made them look like an industrious professional. But Winston noticed their tactical evasion, making him ponder over how Clarence had noticed the same. He remembered how Clarence had confessed about Unity's deception before his untimely demise, their feigned knowledge about maritime history, their meticulously concealed secret, their meticulously fabricated response.\r\n\r\nWinston decided to step back for a bit, reassess his facts and clues. He had a gut feeling that both Clarence's death and Unity's secret were intertwined that this tour wasn't as benign as it seemed. He knew he was onto something. Unity's pride, their faked knowledge, their training with tridents, their constant evasion... While they weren't direct evidence, they were leading him somewhere.\r\n\r\nWith hands in his coat pockets, Winston retreated, mind abuzz with the next steps he needed to take in this intriguing roller rink homicide case. All the while under the riotous strobe lights, Unity's voice continued to echo through the space, meticulously detailing the care for tridents, their twisted pride in their position unfaltering. Even as they stood over a murder scene, they maintained the charade, pretending as if nothing had ever happened.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston scanned over the vivid crime scene for a moment, the macabre tableau horribly out of place in the otherwise cheery atmosphere of a roller rink. Luminescent skates scattered haphazardly over the checkered floors, their normally playful glow eerily reflecting off pools of crimson. His mind slowly pieced together the events that led up to this, putting a face to the victim - Clarence, a man known for spending his every Wednesday nights weaving his way around this very rink on roller skates, his love for the sport unparalleled.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy breath, he set towards his first line of inquiry: Vivian, a woman with an affinity to ancient warfare, the campus vendor, who was known more for her expertise in old military tactics than her concessions. He found her behind a small food counter, her arms steady as she meticulously arranged pretzels on a tray.\r\n\r\n\"Evening, Vivian,\" he greeted, his tone conspicuously casual.\r\n\r\n\"Detective,\" she nodded, not pausing her work. It was clear she respected the gravity the situation held; she just was not going to show it in the middle of her shift.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you have an impressive collection of historical artifacts, some of which include ancient weaponry?\" Winston broached the subject delicately.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she conceded, keeping her gaze lowered. \"One of the weapons being a trident, if I recall correctly.\"\r\n\r\nVivian froze momentarily, to draw breath or collect her thoughts, he couldn't discern. \"Yes, that's correct. I even attended some trident handling courses last summer, part of an educational experience,\" she clarified, her tone suddenly defensive.\r\n\r\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said breezily, not wanting to sharpen the conversation's edge any further. \"Tell me, Vivian. Is it also true that your sister is your only living relative, and you've had to step in to protect her on a few occasions? Like, when a school bully once tormented her?”\r\n\r\nSurprised, Vivian admitted. \"Yes, Detective. My sister means everything to me. I stopped that bully, and I would do anything to keep her safe.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling he was making progress, Winston casually unveiled his most delicate inquiry yet, \"By the way, your sister stopped by earlier.\"\r\n\r\nVivian's back stiffened, a spark of alertness crossing her face. \"She did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Winston replied, trying to suppress any hint of curiosity. \"She mentioned she’d spoken to you about Clarence sending her some inappropriate messages? She said it had particularly upset her, knowing how dedicated Clarence is to his Wednesday night skating sessions.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Vivian looked cornered, before a veil of resignation fell over her face, \"Yes, Detective. We talked about it; she was really upset.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you happened to be working that evening when the incident occurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was,\" Vivian answered quietly, wearing an expression Winston could not decipher.\r\n\r\n\"Interesting night it must've been,\" Winston commented before bidding Vivian a good night.\r\n\r\nAs he walked away, he couldn't help the unsettled feeling creeping up his spine. The circumstances were stacking, and the evening's events were beginning to form a disconcertingly clear narrative. But the writing wasn't on the wall. Not yet. It was, after all, a puzzle he needed to piece together nap by nap, with the reader doing much of the deducing. For now, he'd step aside and allow the story to unfold.",

        "context": "In the sleepy town of Mapleton, the unusual murder of Stella by a nunchaku in her own kitchen has set the stage for Detective Winston's most perplexing case yet.\r\n\r\nAn early morning home visit to investigate a disturbing crime scene had now transitioned into a late afternoon at a strikingly unique boutique-like office.\r\n\r\nThe buzz of industrial sewing machines filled the detective's ear as he entered. The high ceilings, hung with bolts of fabric in every imaginable hue, touched upon the unique operation run within these walls. Winston squinted against the gleaming steel fixtures and sharp angles of modern decor. Models stood like long-legged statues, being prodded, pinned, and fussed over by diligent seamstresses, while students on internship from nearby colleges, huddled together over laptops and design sketches near an overflowing rubbish bin.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Winston caught sight of live security footage from a group of local colleges. All of them were pointed at Emma's studio, and all seemed to be focused on the same event, Emma abruptly closing her computer. Curious, he viewing the footage retrospectively, and, indeed, she had closed her computer abruptly several times in the past days.\r\n\r\nThey appeared from a curtained alcove at the back of the space, shutting their laptop abruptly once more as they noticed the detective’s arrival. Emma, fashion designer extraordinaire, used they/them pronouns and had a style that reflected their non-binary identity, often incorporating bold and androgynous elements into their designs.\r\n\r\n\"Why the visit, Winston?\" Their nonchalant tone betrayed a perplexing mix of audacity and unease.\r\n\r\n\"Just following up on some loose ends,\" he replied, his gaze trained on the computer Emma just closed and the designs they were now carrying in their arms. He asked to see them.\r\n\r\nEmma shuffled nervously and hurriedly tucked them back in their bag.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you've been working late nights recently,\" He said, attempting to keep the conversation flowing casually. \"Your neighbors mentioned seeing your studio lights on until the early hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, you know us designers. Night is when the inspiration hits.\"\r\n\r\nTheir assistant, a young woman with dyed hair, glanced up and gave them a guarded look before quickly shutting her laptop. Winston noticed, but moved on.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you were at Stella's house today. For a fitting in her kitchen, I believe?\"\r\n\r\nEmma nodded, their eyes flicking to the two college interns hunched over a laptop nearby who abruptly closed their devices and busied themselves with the tasks before them.\r\n\r\n\"She liked her fittings at home. Something about the comfort of her own kitchen,\" Emma said with a distant gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Odd place to hold a fitting, a kitchen. Odd place to find her too.\" The silence hung in the air like lead. \"Have you been accused of plagiarism recently?\"\r\n\r\nThe question felt sudden, but Emma's reaction was more telling.\r\n\r\n\"Well...yes, Stella thought I was copying her designs. Stella found my sketches of her upcoming collection when she was at my studio last. She thought I had stolen them, but it was a misunderstanding. She threatened to expose me, but I didn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"Odd,\" Winston interrupted. \"She told me she found something hidden in your studio. Pages from a sketchbook, designs that looked remarkably like her unreleased collection.\"\r\n\r\nEmma was quiet. Winston continued, \"Stella was alone in her kitchen most mornings. And that's where she found herself this morning.\"\r\n\r\nEmma said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe hum of sewing machines filled the room. Winston turned to walk away but paused, \"One final thing, Emma, your business relies heavily on the internet, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's common these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mmm. Might want to be careful what you leave open on your computers around here. I saw the way your assistant and the college interns noticed when you abruptly closed your browser.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, Winston spun on his heel, and strode out of the bustling workspace leaving one very worried fashion designer behind.\r\n\r\nWinston took a deep breath before ringing the bell on the townhouse's front door. Milton graciously accepted the detective into his home and offered him a seat in the sitting room. Gathering his thoughts, Winston began his informal interview.\r\n\r\n\"Milton, it is my understanding that you were at Stella's for dinner on the night of the murder, which took place in her kitchen. Is that correct?\"\r\n\r\nMilton nodded, “Yes, that's correct. I used to visit her quite often for dinner. She was a dear friend of mine,”.\r\n\r\nWinston could detect slight distress in his voice and a gentleness in his eyes. He decided to switch topics.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you’re quite the chemist?\"\r\n\r\nMilton, relieved by the change of conversation, brightened. \"Yes, I've been practicing chemistry for a few decades now. I really enjoy it, makes understanding the world around us a bit easier.\"\r\n\r\nWinston's attention shifted momentarily to a picture frame on a nearby bookshelf; Milton in a martial arts uniform, multiple medals hanging around his neck. He picked it up and inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I see you're into martial arts too. Do you train often?\"\r\n\r\nMilton smiled at the fond memory, \"Ah, yes. I train regularly. For about fifteen years now. Got me a certification too. Helps keep the mind and body balanced you know.”\r\n\r\nWinston, not noticing Milton's boast about his certification, continued to explore the room with his eyes. On a small table by the window, he spotted a pair of nunchaku.\r\n\r\n\"Martial arts, eh?\" Winston held up the nunchaku, Milton watched with a knowing smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, nunchaku is an essential part of martial arts, I practice with those regularly.”\r\n\r\nA moment of silence endured with only the weather outside providing a subtle humming to the room. Winston decided it was time to tap the unspoken tension.\r\n\r\n\"And Milton…,\" Winston leaned forward, \"You were aware that Stella had discovered concrete evidence and was planning to expose your fraudulent practices in your work, weren’t you?\"\r\n\r\nMilton swallowed audibly before answering. \"Yes, Stella had found concrete evidence of my unethical practices at work which she didn’t agree with, and was planning to expose me. My dear friend was indeed honorable like that…”\r\n\r\nWinston leaned back, processing this information silently.\r\n\r\nAnd without a word, Winston excused himself from the room.",

        "context": "In the sleepy town of Mapleton, the unusual murder of Stella by a nunchaku in her own kitchen has set the stage for Detective Winston's most perplexing case yet.\r\n\r\nEmma, the renowned fashion designer, was having quite the morning with her martial arts training. Nothing out of the ordinary. Her classmates know her to be systematic, picking up the pace at which she had been twirling the nunchaku around; she had been at this for a while. Today's training session ended with each student placing their nunchaku back in its storage area. Emma, being one of the last attendees to leave, noticed that the instructor was already preoccupied with another task and wasn't paying attention. This allowed Emma to slyly pocket her training Nunchaku, unnoticed by everyone. Emma usually attended these classes regularly, blending easily within her group, never causing a fuss.\r\n\r\nEmma's next stop was Stella's. Winston examined Emma's calendar and noted that she and Stella had an appointment back at Stella's home for a fitting. Stella liked having her fittings at home, right there in the kitchen. Their appointment was routine; the kitchen was the best spot for Stella to have a fitting given its large, airy space. Moreover, Stella had always been known to spend her mornings truly alone, right there in the kitchen. This allowed her to enjoy her solitude without attracting any attention or interruptions. There's no harm in using it as a makeshift studio.\r\n\r\nWhile Emma was working in Stella's kitchen, Stella had taken it upon herself to visit Emma's studio. Emma didn't mind. She knew her studio was a secure private space, no prying eyes to worry about. But then, something piqued Stella's interest. She found a hidden stack of papers from Emma's sketchbook. Intrigued, Stella began looking more closely at the sketches. They were designs of a new collection, never before seen. And as she scrutinized them, a glassy look came over Stella's eyes. These designs resembled her own unlaunched collection, she realized.\r\n\r\nEmma had arrived back at the studio to find Stella stiff with anger and an odd collection of sketch pages in her hand. Stella looked up at Emma, her features hardening as she accused her of plagiarism and threatened to expose her.\r\n\r\nDespite Emma's flair for art and design, this niche of Stella's discovery in her studio led Winston back to the martial arts class and how Emma had learned to expertly handle the nunchaku. He found it peculiar that such a unique weapon was the weapon of choice in Stella's demise. More peculiar and somewhat perplexing was how Emma would have found an opportunity to carry a pair of the increasingly rare weapon, nunchaku to the crime scene without anyone noticing. This case was turning out to be more intriguing than Winston had initially assumed; a fashion designer, a nunchaku, and a quiet kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhile smoking on his half-bitten down cigar, Winston rubbed the corner of his eye, trying to make sense of the gruesome, disarming photographs of Stella's murder scene in her own kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere was a mere few facts he had that could be of any substance for the detective, one of which was that nunchaku was held responsible for the cause of death, synonymous with martial arts, that made Winston think of Milton, a martial arts enthusiast appearing rather benign, who used they/them pronouns and had a calm demeanor.\r\n\r\nAnother fact he'd picked up on was that Milton had been invited by Stella for dinner that fatal night. Winston stomped out his cigar, inaudibly muttered 'no holds barred,' and prepared to interview his suspect of interest - Milton.\r\n\r\nArriving at the local dojo, after a short spar, a sweat-drenched Milton, sporting their martial arts certification belt, made their way over to Winston.\r\n\r\n\"Hi Detective,\" greeted Milton offering a tepid smile.\r\n\r\n\"Milton,\" acknowledged Winston commenting, \"see you're stickin' to your trainin' regimen.\"\r\n\r\nAdjusting their martial arts belt, Milton nodded, \"It's a passion, yes sir, good way to keep fit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were invited to Stella's last night for dinner, ain't that right?\" inquired Winston, his eyes never leaving Milton's face.\r\n\r\nTaken aback by Winston's sudden mention of Stella, Milton blurted, \"Y-yes. I was invited...we were good friends and I was often at her place for dinner. I found out this morning...that she was murdered in her own kitchen after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nOne eyebrow arched skeptically, Winston questioned further, \"and you left her house when, after dessert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got a call from trace analysis,\" Winston's phone intercepted abruptly, \"looks like the local journalist sent over some more pictures of Milton. They were captured in various locations, which we later discovered were areas of Tommy's gang activity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Winston, we also got a picture of Milton with Tommy at the local bar,\" the voice continued, \"judging from the photo, Tommy's living up to his reputation as a troublemaker - even in the bar, his henchmen are always around him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milton, how'd you account for your presence at these 'areas of interest'?\" Winston asked, showing them the freshly received photos over the phone.\r\n\r\nMilton looked stunned, \"I had...I had no idea about this. I did meet Tommy once at the bar, but...\"\r\n\r\nBefore they could finish their defense, Winston wrapped up, \"It's getting late, Milton, let's continue this another day.\"\r\n\r\nAs Winston drove off, he glanced at another picture sent over from forensics featuring Milton and Tommy, both laughing over drinks at a local bar with Tommy's henchmen lurking in the background, serving as a chilling background to his already twisted thoughts of the case.",

        "context": "In the garish glow of a wrestling ring, Isabelle found her end at the prongs of a trident; now, it's up to Detective Winston to untangle the enigmatic web spun by two prime suspects, Lance and Harper.\r\n\r\nWinston foraged through his notes, hands constantly moving like a man possessed.\r\n\r\nIsabelle was dead, found cold in the wrestling ring. The crime scene was hauntingly silent, yet William could still faintly hear the echoes of a crowd, a crowd that once chanted their names. He gazed at the trident left behind. It wasn't common fare in a wrestling ring, but it had historians agreeing of its gladiatorial significance, as it was a commonly used weapon in gladiatorial combat, a whisper of a different time.\r\n\r\nHe drove to meet Harper, his only credible lead so far. As Winston pulled up in front of Harper’s residence, their neighbours had only warm greetings for them. 'They're a well-mannered individual, a real beacon to our community,' one old man mused with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Harper?” Winston asked, stepping forward with an extended hand, deciding to go straight to the point, “Did you hear about Isabelle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a tragedy…” Harper replied, their eyes dodging Winston's, evasively looking around, \"Isabelle... She threatened to uncover something...\" Their voice trailed off and their face was etched with tangible fear. It was clear that Harper was terrified of Isabelle's threat to expose them.\r\n\r\n“You were part of a local gladiator reenactment group, weren’t you?” Winston probed, aware from his sources that the group required serious physical preparation and training. Winston glanced at Harper’s tough physique; it made sense. He then gazed at the array of replica gladiatorial weapons displayed on the shelves behind Harper. They nodded rather reluctantly without saying a word.\r\n\r\nWinston, changing the topic, asked, “I hear your fascination with crime stretches beyond just books?”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Harper admitted, “Yes, I enjoy books about crime – a morbid fascination, you could say. The bookstore clerk sees me often, buying many crime novels. The members of my book club and I often have lively debates on forensics too.”\r\n\r\nConsidering their confession, Winston made a mental note to check the bookstore. Upon consultation with the local bookstore clerk, it was confirmed that Harper was a frequenter. They had been spotted buying novels from the true crime section multiple times.\r\n\r\nAccording to his sources, Isabelle knew Harper had been involved in some kind of illegal activities. In fact, the twisted secret that Isabelle threatened to reveal involved Harper’s clandestine dealings.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, he remembered Harper rolling up their sleeves to shake his hand, and a retrospective glimpse of their physique leaving no doubt about the extensive physical conditioning they must undergo for their stash of staged battles, yet another piece of potential insight into the power and strength that Harper wielded. The pieces were beginning to fit into place, scattered fragments of a life lived under the radar.\r\n\r\nWinston pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to stave off the oncoming headache as he sifted through numerous witness statements. His mind kept coming back to one name: Lance.\r\n\r\nIsabelle and this Lance fellow were often seen together with Lance referring to her as his wife. But according to what several sources corroborated, Isabelle had mentioned to a close friend, while in earshot of Lance, that she was planning on divorcing him. Lance had not been coy about admitting that he had indeed overheard this conversation.\r\n\r\nWinston's weary eyes moved towards the photos of the crime scene. The wrestling ring, normally throbbing with life, seemed void in the ominous light of the flash. Isabelle's life had ended here, in the very wrestling ring that was part of the event Lance was directing.\r\n\r\nAs he looked closely at a photo of the bloodied mat, his eyes drifted to a piece of prop laying just out of the boundary of the ring. Lance and his crew handled these props, and Lance himself had been seen practicing with props similar to the one near the crime scene - a trident. He knew Lance had a penchant for ancient weapons, often seen studying or collecting them. It seemed these props were more than just set dressing to Lance.\r\n\r\nWinston scratched his chin, pondering. Lance's life revolved around his shows. He loved directing them. This wrestling match, the scene of the crime, was one such event he was in charge of.\r\n\r\nWith a final sigh, the detective gathered his things. There still was much left to uncover. Soon after, he found himself in the production area of the show, meeting with Lance.\r\n\r\n\"Lance, I presume?\" Winston asked, offering a hand. The man nodded, taking Winston's hand into a firm grip.\r\n\r\n\"Winston. I'm... I'm here about your wife, Isabelle.\"\r\n\r\nLance's eyes clouded over for a second before he pushed past the emotions, \"Let's talk then, detective.\"",

        "context": "In the garish glow of a wrestling ring, Isabelle found her end at the prongs of a trident; now, it's up to Detective Winston to untangle the enigmatic web spun by two prime suspects, Lance and Harper.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston shuffled his papers, his gaze landed on the case file of the victim: Isabelle. She was found dead in a wrestling ring in their hometown. He took a deep breath, steadying his nerves. This case was made more challenging due to the unusual murder weapon: a trident. As he looked over the information he had gathered on Harper and her impressive collection of gladiatorial weapons, he departed his office, heading to the home of the chief suspect.\r\n\r\nHarper wasn't a stranger to Isabelle; in fact, they once shared a life as a couple, but that was an extinguished flame now. Harper was now Isabelle's ex-wife. Her name adds intrigue to the investigation exactly due to their previous relationship. Considering their former status, places familiar to Isabelle, like the backstage of the local wrestling tournament they frequented, would not be unfamiliar territory for Harper too.\r\n\r\nHis investigation directed him to the site of the wrestling tournament, held in Harper's hometown. Harper, like her former spouse, was a robust woman. She was part of a local Gladiator reenactment group that demanded rigorous physical preparation and conditioning. Isabelle was involved too, but the wrestling was more her specialty compared to Harper's gladiatorial passion. The trident, a weapon from an ancient time, was the weapon of choice amongst Gladiator re-enactors -- meaning, Harper had easy access to similar weapons.\r\n\r\nNumerous eyewitness accounts confirmed they saw Harper entering the backstage area on the day of the murder.\r\n\r\nIt had been a day of hurried investigation when Winston decided to visit the local Gladiator reenactment group. As he approached, he watched Harper spar intensely with another reenactor, clutching a trident just like the one found near Isabelle's body. When the sparring session ended, he introduced himself.\r\n\r\n\"Detective Winston.\" He stretched out his hand, and Harper, wiping the sweat from her forehead, shook it.\r\n\r\n\"Harper, right?\" he asked, and she nodded, not particularly off balance by his question but puzzled nonetheless.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, what can I do for you, Detective?\" Harper asked, offering a polite smile. She had a significant position in this community; her reputation was one of respect and trust.\r\n\r\n\"Just a few questions, Harper,\" Winston promised, his gaze briefly scanning the impressive assortment of gladiatorial weaponry she owned, clearly marking Harper's interest and involvement in the historical fighting.\r\n\r\nOn her part, Harper didn't betray any discomfort or restriction. She seemed eager to answer his questions, her commitment to the reenactment group and her schedule also seemed open, her timetable in the city not showing signs that she was bound by any travel limitations during the timeline Winston was interested in.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Isabelle threatened to expose a secret, one that involved Harper's dubious dealings. Winston had to tread lightly. This was sensitive information, a notion Harper obviously lived in terror of, as it could damage both her personal and professional life.\r\n\r\nSeeing Harper, calculating his next move in this complicated dance, Winston grappled with the elements of this case. The trident, the connection between the former lovers, Harper's affinity for gladiatorial combat, her collection of weaponry, the backstage sighting on the day of the murder, the wrestling tournament held in the city, and the looming threat of a public revelation all tangled together in a mysterious, deadly pattern. Yet, as always, he had to remind himself - a suspect was just that, a suspect. Until proven guilty.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston was poring over the pile of paperwork on his desk when a curious document caught his eye - a film production permit, freshly filed by none other than Lance, the director of the ongoing wrestling show. Lance, who used they/them pronouns, had a reputation for being meticulous with their work.\r\n\r\nHe began piecing together the information he'd gathered. As it turns out, Lance had been planning to film at a cabin, located deep within the woods. An off-the-grid location, it was certainly a far cry from the state-of-the-art studios in downtown.\r\n\r\nWinston leans back in his chair, giving it a thoughtful swivel. He took a mental break and instead focused his attention on the next round of rehearsals. Recently, someone had reported seeing Lance practicing with a trident. Even for a wrestling show, a trident might have been deemed... unusual.\r\n\r\nWhen the rehearsals concluded, Winston took the opportunity to approach Lance. Though not particularly forthcoming, Lance repeatedly referred to Isabelle as their wife while acknowledging their involvement in handling the props, alongside the rest of the crew, and their fondness for studying and collecting ancient weapons.\r\n\r\nDuring their slight chit-chat, an unprompted Lance revealed that they had, only yesterday, overheard a troubling conversation between Isabelle and her friend. The words that hit them like a band of drumrolls - Isabelle had decided to divorce them. Their desolate eyes echoed the heart-rending shock of the news they had not been prepared for.\r\n\r\nAs Winston was making his exit, he caught sight of Lance loading expensive looking filming equipment into a van. The van was parked outside a cabin that seemed to match the setting as described in the script of Lance's upcoming film.\r\n\r\nShaking hands with staff and crew, Winston took the opportunity to engage in small talk. Information flowed freely, like a backstage cocktail party, and Winston learned more about the dynamic between Lance and Isabelle.\r\n\r\nA crew member mentioned overhearing a conversation between Isabelle and her friend regarding a divorce. Isabelle's bold proclamation still echoed in their ears: she had decided to divorce Lance.",

He pulled out a crumpled picture of Chloe from his pocket and sighed, replaying the explosion at the movie theatre over and over in his mind, as well as the image of Jake, the man he's spotted Chloe with on numerous clandestine dates.\r\n\r\n\"Ruby,\" he began. His voice was low and weary. \"I understand that you and Chloe had planned a sister-courtship to the movies last night.\"\r\n\r\nA flicker of surprise crossed Ruby's face. \"Why, yes. Chloe wanted to see that new film, The Scarlet Phoenix. We enjoyed a night at the theater till the very end. Nobody else entered or left the theater during our stay - it was just us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston. \"And there were eyewitnesses confirming that you were the last person seen with Chloe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ruby hesitatingly,\"We departed together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston, making no further comment. Instead, he considered the reported vision of Ruby seeing Chloe kissing another man. Another man who turned out to be Jake.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you might have feelings for Jake. Is that right?\" Winston questioned, watching Ruby carefully.\r\n\r\nRuby hesitated, playing with the locket around her neck. “Yes, I suppose that's true,” she admitted, but never meeting his gaze.\r\n\r\nThe detective changed the angle of the conversation. “I've heard tales about your psychic abilities, Ruby. You tend to see dangerous things. Your visions included dreadful bomb scenarios back when you were in the military, right?”\r\n\r\n\"I've had visions,\" Ruby replied defensively. \"Visions are often ambiguous. They can symbolize various scenarios. I did see Chloe, Chloe kissing another man... Jake. And yes, during my service, I’ve seen how war and destruction unfold, even how to use grenades.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Winston said, thinking to himself. Connecting the dots, he continued, \"Did you know that Jake and Chloe were secretly seeing each other?\"\r\n\r\nRuby's apprehension told Winston everything he needed to know. \"Yes, I knew. Chloe told me about it,\" she said, her face growing pale.\r\n\r\n\"Did you also stay behind after the movie, in the theatre?\" Winston asked, looking at Ruby sternly.\r\n\r\n\"We both enjoyed the ending credits music, so we stayed till the end. I distinctly remember walking out of the theatre last night, but... alone,\" Ruby said, hinting at her absence following the movie's completion.\r\n\r\nWinston allowed a moment's pause before continuing on. \"Ruby, where did you go after the movie ended?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went to my brother's house,\" Ruby's reply was swift, a touch too swift.\r\n\r\nWinston blinked, remembering her brother's notorious reputation as an arms dealer, and Ruby's own military background. \"That's... convenient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is,\" Ruby replied quietly, eyes fixed on the policeman's tired, yet zealous gaze. The meeting was concluded with that, leaving Winston with the chilling evening wind and another lead in Chloe's puzzling demise.\r\n\r\nWinston glanced at the movie ticket stub Roscoe held, noting that it was for the same film as Chloe. He squinted at Roscoe, who used they/them pronouns and had a style that blended masculine and feminine elements in a way that was uniquely their own, but his current disheveled appearance suggested a disconnect.\r\n\r\n\"You were here at the theatre when the event happened, then?\" Winston asked, gesturing at the ticket. Roscoe was indeed there before the movie started, now confirmed by the timing on his ticket.\r\n\r\nA confirmed nod came from Roscoe, who avoided meeting Winston’s gaze. \"Yeah, I was here. Same movie as her.\" Their voice dropped lower. \"When the incident occurred during the movie screening. Chloe... She didn't make it.\"\r\n\r\nWinston hesitated, knowing Chloe's death wasn't the only thing he needed to discuss today. Throughout their conversation, Winston noticed a limp in Roscoe's step, bruises, and a sharp wince when they moved a certain way. \"Looks like you've got some injuries there,\" Winston remarked casually.\r\n\r\nThough he spoke offhandedly, Roscoe was quick to brush it off, often changing the subject when questioned about their injuries, which drew Winston’s attention. More so than before, Winston observed, people tended to notice when someone was deliberately avoiding a topic.\r\n\r\nTrying not to push too far, Winston paused momentarily - but then he remembered the drug bag found in Roscoe’s possession at the theater. He recalled a report from resident neighbors as well, Mr. & Mrs. Davenport, stating that they've often seen Roscoe limping into their apartment late in the night, disheveled and pained. Further arousing suspicion was the doorman’s testimony, reporting a similar disheveled state during the late-night arrivals.\r\n\r\nRemaining cognizant of the consequences to Roscoe’s situation if they were to be caught using drugs, Winston pressed on, \"Roscoe, I've heard you've been behaviorally inconsistent lately. And there’s the matter of the confiscated drug bag. Do you understand the negative implications this could have?\"\r\n\r\nRoscoe visibly flinched. Their demeanor took on a nervous edge, scratching their arm as it often did when they felt cornered. Winston’s gaze hardened, feeling certain that Roscoe was not the one he was looking for.\r\n\r\n“I...uh got to use the restroom,\" Roscoe stammered before rushing off, undoubtedly the effects of the drugs kicking in.\r\n\r\nWinston decided to follow, needing more answers. Was Roscoe involved in Chloe's demise? With renewed determination, Winston set off after them.\r\n\r\nAs Winston neared the restroom, he was eerily reminded of the nearly empty crime scene — a movie theatre mid-showing. He shuddered at the thought of the panic that ensued when the grenade went off during the screening.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time for that now, he had a suspect to confront.",

It was a terrible scene involving a grenade explosion, a midnight movie, and a tragedy. Winston ran a hand over his tired face as he recollected the events of the night. The victim, Chloe, had invited Ruby, a local psychic with a unique talent of foreseeing dangerous situations in her visions, to the movies.

Ruby, who used they/them pronouns, had a distinctive style that set them apart, but it was their talent that had drawn Chloe to them.\r\n\r\nThey'd stayed until the late night showing ended, and witnesses mentioned they were the last to leave. They also confirmed that none other individuals were seen entering or exiting the theater.\r\n\r\nWinston made his way to the torn-up cinema, stooping to look at the grenaded remains. The air was still heavy with the acrid residue of the explosion. Ruby, the psychic. Ruby, the military veteran. He suppressed a shudder as he thought about the fatalities they might have presaged in their past, with the shadow of a grenade always lingering in their visions, all too accurate.\r\n\r\nIn situations like these, they could have known how to handle a grenade, their service in the military would have ensured that. He had heard about this psychic's history. Ruby's accuracy was unsettling... Their record of predicting family tragedies had created an odd mix of fear and respect amongst their kin. They were a superstitious lot, some even believed that their visions were causing the very catastrophes they prophesied.\r\n\r\nWinston beckoned an officer over, borrowing his notepad and pen to jot down some reminders. Ruby was last seen with Chloe. Ruby went to their brother’s house after the movie - The brother, who also happens to be an arms dealer.\r\n\r\nWinston made his way to Ruby's apartment for an interview. Ruby had a feral look about them - their argument with their mother had clearly shaken them. They had decided to break off contact with their family after that blowout. Both of them seemed to be quite stubborn.\r\n\r\n\"Ruby,\" Winston began, \"Can you tell me about the last time you saw Chloe?\" He asked, his steely gaze fixing on them.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Detective. We watched a movie together. It ran late, we both stayed until the end.\" Ruby replied.\r\n\r\n\"And after the movie?\" Winston probed.\r\n\r\n\"I... I went to visit my brother. He sells... various products. I remember when we played with toy soldiers as children...\" Ruby’s voice trailed off, an odd glint in their eyes.\r\n\r\nKeeping his inquisitive gaze steady, Winston made his leave, leaving Ruby and their prophecies, often echoing with the sound of pin-pulled grenades, alone with the evening shadows.\r\n\r\nWinston rubbed his temples as he sifted through the mountain of paperwork on his desk. What a way to spend his Sunday, pouring over case files and suspect lists. He moved onto the next file on his desk: Roscoe, an astrophysicist by day, apparent drug addict by night.\r\n\r\nHis astrophysics job had Roscoe planted in a military base, which was known to have an arsenal that included grenades, for research purposes. Here, he utilized his broad scientific background including physics and chemistry. Although he normally processed information in a meticulous and scientific manner, witness testimonies painted a different picture altogether. Apparently, Roscoe had been acting erratically lately. Having a quick look at his employee records, Winston saw a slew of complaints piled up within the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nRoscoe's troubles found their way outside of the workplace, into a small apartment where he was the tenant. When the police were called for a noise complaint, they found drug paraphernalia scattered across the living room. Surely, his military career would see its last days if word got out.\r\n\r\nWinston sighed, leaning back in his chair, skimming through his notes. He paused at the mention of a late-night movie. Chloe, the unfortunate victim, had been Roscoe's unsuspecting companion in the dark theater. Just as the opening credits rolled, her life had been cut short by a grenade.\r\n\r\nWitness statements gathered at the scene confirmed that Roscoe had purchased a ticket for the same movie screening just moments before it began. Someone had seen him enter the theater, seemingly in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\"These cases just keep getting trickier,\" Winston muttered to himself, downing another cup of coffee. His eyes moved to another statement, this time by one of Chloe's friends. It seemed that Chloe was about to report Roscoe's drug addiction to his superiors.\r\n\r\nWinston called Roscoe's workplace. \"Is that Roscoe's current position?\" he asked the person on the other end. \"Have you noticed anything... odd about his behavior lately?\" He listened carefully to the responses, his face impassive.\r\n\r\n\"No further questions,\" Winston said as he bid goodbye and hung up the office phone. He then picked up another folder from the desk, ready to tackle the next round of information.",

However, they also had an alibi for the time of the explosion, as they visited their brother (an arms dealer) after the movie.\n\n2. Roscoe:\n   - Motive: Roscoe's erratic behavior and the fact that Chloe was about to report his drug addiction to his superiors could have provided him with a motive to eliminate her.\n   - Means: Roscoe worked in a military base, which had an arsenal that included grenades for research purposes.\n   - Opportunity: Witnesses saw Roscoe enter the theater just moments before the explosion, giving him access to the crime scene.\n\nComparing the two suspects, while both have motive and means, only Roscoe has clear opportunity, as he was seen entering the theater before the explosion. On the other hand, Ruby had an alibi for the time of the crime.

        "context": "When Keira's lifeless body was discovered in an airplane bathroom, and a shotgun was found tucked beneath a seat, Detective Winston stepped forward to interrogate the only suspects: Angela and Roy.\r\n\r\nIn the haze of flashing lights and the flurry of police activity, Detective Winston found himself reflecting on the scene before him— a once lively session of travel had turned into a horrifying crime scene. Keira, an acclaimed actress, met a gruesome end somewhere above the clouds within the confines of an airplane.\r\n\r\nHe peered at the seating plan. Keira and a certain individual, Roy, who used they/them pronouns, had been ensconced close to each other. Roy's presence intrigued Winston. Being someone with a flair for the dramatic, Roy had open access to the movie equipment. In their interactions, they had even been responsible for the movie equipment. Winston quietly wondered how Roy felt about handling equipment so closely. The movie currently in production, as Winston learned, even had a sequence where a shotgun was fired. Apart from equipment, though, Roy was qualified to handle guns. The knowledge made Winston's eyes narrow, and a sense of unease lingered in the air.\r\n\r\nWinston turned his attention to the individual interviews. Part of his job, however unappealing. He questioned Roy's social circle, most of which agreed to having seen Roy use cocaine during parties. Roy themselves confessed to their social indulgences— admitted their use of cocaine at similar social events. Winston found cocaine in their car during what was supposed to be a regular traffic stop. Even a casual search of their wallet at the scene had brought Winston into contact with traces of cocaine on Roy's dollar bills.\r\n\r\nWinston caught Roy at a moment when they were wide awake, clearly not burdened with any tasks at hand. They had been travelling with Keira for the upcoming movie shoot. They were setting up an interesting dynamic, and Winston found himself teetering on the edge of answers just beyond his grasp. As the evening drew closer to the end, a haunting stillness took hold over the airplane as Winston took notes, suitably filed away with an enigmatic individual named Roy.\r\n\r\nAs Detective Winston sat in the bustling airport terminal, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had entered into a scene straight out of a soap opera. Keira, the victim, had been brutally shot on an airplane mid-flight. It beggared belief but, somehow, it weirdly made the situation even more intriguing, albeit less appealing.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the investigation was Angela, a woman who had ties everywhere – friend, confidante, protector, and presently, a suspect. Their history ran deep. Angela was a bridesmaid at Keira's wedding, had a notable protective streak for Keira's groom – Sam, and yet, was the primary person of interest. Winston made his way towards her, among the small group of wedding party attendees.\r\n\r\nWinston introduced himself to the shabby-looking Angela, \"Hello, Angela.\" Noting her silence, he continued, \"I heard you were in control of the suitcases for the wedding party?\"\r\n\r\nAngela responded, \"Yes, I was,\" her tone curt. \"They had my dresses, makeup, everyone's things... But, I didn't check them. Nobody did. We were a wedding party, not criminals!\" Her voice shook with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Did I also hear correctly that you're frequently found hunting?\" Winston asked her. At this, Angela’s face lit up as she began to talk about her fondness for the sport, the serenity of the woods, the excitement of the chase, and her marksmanship skills that had even earned her a few awards.\r\n\r\nSam, in deep sorrow, was to their side, reflecting on his cold interactions with Keira during their last days together. As Winston headed towards Sam, Angela's focus followed.\r\n\r\nCognizant of Sam’s grief, Winston crouched next to him, saying, \"I heard matters between you and Keira had turned frosty recently, is that true?\" Sam merely nodded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Angela was seen in a particularly heated conversation with a friend close by. Snippets of their conversation reached Winston, revealing Angela expressing her affection for Sam and resentment over Keira's plans to replace him after the trip. Angela had backed into a corner, recalling overhearing a devastating conversation – Keira telling a friend about her plan to dump Sam after the trip.\r\n\r\nThese bits and pieces of information swirled in Winston’s mind, a puzzle in the making. He knew it was vital to earn the trust of all those involved, a daunting task given that a whole wedding party was under suspicion. A wedding party that had flown together to attend what should have been a joyous occasion, now marred by tragedy and shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nAs Winston exited the lounge that day, he was gripped by an image – Angela, fiercely arguing with Keira. Angela, a woman in love with Sam, was openly confronting Keira over her plans to dump Sam. Had that argument led to this regrettable end? Only time would tell. All he knew was, unravelling this convoluted puzzle was going to be a task.",

The crime scene photographs laid out on his desk seemed far-fetched, yet chillingly real. The circumstances were more Hollywood than real life; a body on a plane and a shotgun involved. The wedding party, including Keira and Angela, had travelled together to the destination for the wedding.\r\n\r\nAs he took a sip of his lukewarm coffee, he forced down the bitter taste, and turned his attention to the suspect in question; Angela, the Maid of Honor, who used they/them pronouns and had a distinctive style that blended effortlessly with the rest of the wedding party. Apparently, they had been quite the participant in Keira’s wedding party; even had the responsibility for the suitcases.\r\n\r\nKeira's life seemed to have ended prematurely, and one piece of information struck Winston immediately. Keira and Angela were reported to have had a fierce argument over Sam, Keira's boyfriend. From what he could gather, Angela had more than platonic feelings towards Sam. They had been spotted several times, gazing at him at the party with longing in their eyes. Furthermore, it seemed Angela knew a secret. Keira was planning to dump Sam after their trip, leaving him heartbroken. This argument about Sam and Angela's secret feelings towards him, seemed like a potential motive.\r\n\r\nAs Winston flipped through the case files, a detail about Angela's past caught his eye. They were an award-winning sharpshooter. Interesting. They also had a penchant for hunting... regularly. Another sip of coffee followed this revelation.\r\n\r\nAn initial testimony revealed that there had been no security checks for the suitcases and Angela was responsible for managing them. Was that a coincidence or a calculated move?\r\n\r\nAngela left the party late in the night and their departure seemed odd. What made it more unsettling was that shortly after Keira was last seen, Angela was sighted entering their house. Angela and Keira had been at the same party that night.\r\n\r\nHe swirled the last bit of his coffee in the paper cup. There were still many clues to decode and pieces to connect. Nonetheless, the facts were all laid out in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe finally exited his office, determined. Personal disagreement, unchecked suitcases, a late-night departure, and a secret crush... Winston knew he needed answers. The puzzle wasn’t complete. As he stepped into his car, he knew his next move - he had to interview Angela.\r\n\r\nWinston drummed his fingers on his notepad, waiting for Roy in the gritty staff room of the film set. In the room, a plethora of props scattered about - fake wigs, fake blood, all the tools of the trade for making movie magic look real. Among them, oddly enough, was a shotgun - a prop for one of the upcoming scenes.\r\n\r\nHe was here to interview Roy, a makeup artist by title, but wearing many hats in reality. Besides artfully painting faces, he handled the props and was even a certified gun handler, quite an unusual combination of skills, Winston thought not for the first time.\r\n\r\nFinally, Roy sauntered into the room, looking dishevelled but alert despite the insanely late hour. His eyes, through years of experience, immediately began to scrutinize Winston's face as if preparing to apply foundation and concealer.\r\n\r\nBefore his eyes could do his work, Winston began. \"Mr. Roy, could you explain a bit about your relationship with Ms. Keira?\"\r\n\r\nRoy's face muscle twitched noticeably at his question. Resisting the urge to highlight this, Winston continued.\r\n\r\n\"Were you two traveling together for the movie shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Roy murmured. \"She was seated near me during the flight.\" Winston then chose to ease into a more delicate topic to officially address the rumor. \"The passengers reported seeing Keira being intimate with another man on the flight, a man who was not you. It created quite a commotion.\"\r\n\r\nRoy swallowed hard, \"I confronted her about it, of course. But she simply dismissed it as casual flirting, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that it's a part of your job to handle the props in the films you work on, including firearms?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Roy sighed, his eyes wandering far beyond the confines of the room. \"There was this scene involving a fired shotgun in the movie we were working on.\"\r\n\r\nA ‘ding’ from Roy’s phone caught his attention. Winston noticed him unholstering his phone to view an incoming message, just like the day when Roy found explicit messages on Keira's phone that confirmed her infidelity.\r\n\r\nNoticing Roy’s quiet discomfort, Winston prodded further, “You were wide awake and idle the night Keira was murdered, weren't you?”\r\n\r\nRoy flickered a gaze at Winston but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"It must have felt like a dream,\" Winston muttered, musing on his own thoughts rather than posing a question. \"To watch someone intimate with another man while ignoring your confrontations. It can make anyone lose composure. You were awake and not busy, is it because you were thinking about the scene you witnessed in the plane?\"\r\n\r\nRoy didn't answer, his hardened gaze holding Winston's.

        "context": "In the cold echo of a deserted hockey rink, Otis was found dead from a grenade explosion, and now Detective Winston must decipher the clues, suspecting Ervin and Andrew are somehow involved.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston rubbed his temples while the facts flickered across his computer screen. Otis, the victim, would most definitely be missed. His usual vibrant energy that filled the hockey rink was replaced by cold, solemn silence.\r\n\r\nSome contradictions needed to be resolved. The crime scene at the hockey rink was empty, both at the time of the murder and throughout the investigation. Winston's only lead was Andrew, who was an old military pal of Otis. Winston heard that Andrew had recently switched his career to become a solo hiking guide. Indeed, a remarkable part of his solo hikes was his ability to help hikers they came across on the way overcome environmental dangers—a way of applying his skills acquired from his military service. It was an unusual practice in the industry but allowed due to his military expertise in bomb disposal—an odd career choice for a person of such skills.\r\n\r\nWinston drove to the outskirts of the town, where Andrew lived in a remote cabin. Andrew, who used they/them pronouns, lived a solitary life, and their solo job didn't always welcome company, but that didn't seem to bother them. Rumor had it that they used their military skills to help strangers on the trails overcome environmental dangers—detonating falling rocks, perhaps?\r\n\r\nOnce in the cabin, Winston noticed several hiking supplies meticulously arranged. He inspected them and found, hidden strategically among the normal hiking necessities—food, water, emergency kit—were several small explosives. Chills ran down his spine as he remembered a recent break-in at a military base.\r\n\r\n\"I see you have explosives mixed with your hiking guide supplies,” Winston said, trying to evoke a reaction.\r\n\r\nAndrew replied calmly, “Those are just for emergencies.”\r\n\r\nListening to Andrew, Winston remembered that Otis had been friendly with them. Otis was always open with Andrew about his daily habits, even shared his calendar with them. Andrew was the only person who knew Otis would be alone at the hockey rink that evening.\r\n\r\nOn his way out, Winston remembered Andrew's frank words, \"I don't like to hang out after work.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed somewhat true, living far from town, working alone, and being prone to avoid after-work hangouts. Winston thought to himself: Andrew did like to be alone. It all seemed so strange, the grenade murder, the empty hockey rink, Andrew’s distant demeanor. However, he couldn't draw any obvious conclusions just yet. He needed more.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston sat on the chilly bleachers of the local hockey rink, a place as familiar to him as it was to Ervin, the mild-mannered Rabbi who had never missed a game. The rink was still splattered with telltale signs of the merciless violence that had taken place there. Otis had been killed during a game, a seemingly jovial event turned nightmarish by the unexpected detonation of a grenade.\r\n\r\nTaking his eyes off the crime scene momentarily, he scanned his surroundings and spotted his next person of interest: Ervin, a massive hockey fan, and a staunch supporter of their local team. His presence at the game had been expected, as his dedicated attendance was part of the everyday routine. Some of the spectators had mentioned Ervin stepping out of the stadium briefly, interestingly around the same time Otis was killed.\r\n\r\nNot missing his beat, Winston approached Rabbi Ervin, who was still in deep shock at the loss of a fellow spectator and friend, “Rabbi Ervin?”\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi looked up to meet the detective's prying eyes, “I am Ervin, indeed. And you are?”\r\n\r\n“I am Detective Winston, investigating the recent unfortunate event.”\r\n\r\nObserving Ervin's face closely, Winston began: \"The strangest thing happened a few days ago. Otis came to me and told me he was planning to go to the authorities. He knew something was off, dangerous even. I guess we didn't react quickly enough. He mentioned your name, Ervin, and something about another life before the synagogue…”\r\n\r\nErvin was quiet, his gaze distant but thoughtful. \"Yes, Otis did confront me. He saw me moving some funds around. He saw, Detective, he saw me committing the crime which I've regretted every day since,\" Ervin confessed.\r\n\r\nWinston let the confession sink in before shifting the subject subtly. \"I heard you were in the military?\"\r\n\r\nErvin smiled, just barely, nodding with a touch of pride. \"Yes, I am a former military officer. Had a special training in demolitions you see, before I found my calling in religion.\"\r\n\r\nWinston returned his smile, \"I suppose it's a bit of a leap from demolitions to the pulpit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a tad,\" Ervin's laughter is soft. \"But the old life stays with you in ways you wouldn't expect. I've got a collection of war memorabilia back home. host some of my friends over sometimes, they marvel at these artifacts. I even got grenades in there. Nothing active, of course. They tend to catch the eye.”\r\n\r\nWinston excused himself, leaving Ervin to mourn at the crash of their sanctuary of play turned battleground.",

When you see something new, you remember it, he mused.\r\n\r\nThe town had been buzzing since Ervin's angry outburst in the synagogue last Sunday. Bystanders had recounted to Winston how Ervin had been shouting at a particular customer he had been consulting with, before the outburst escalated and he stormed off into the synagogue. The same customer Walter Harrison was who Ervin had consulted with before he stormed off into the synagogue, had recounted it to him with fear in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"And you say you were trembling after the confrontation, Mr. Harrison?\" Winston asked after the customer finished recounting Ervin's worrying reaction.\r\n\r\n\"N-not just a confrontation,\" the distressed customer stammered, \"Ervin, our Rabbi, they lost it – punching the walls, shouting at everyone. There’s still a visible dent where they hit.\"\r\n\r\nWinston gave a slight nod, “Thank you for your cooperation,” he said before heading toward the synagogue to track down Rabbi Ervin.\r\n\r\nErvin Thornberg, the Rabbi, met Winston's inquiring gaze coolly. Ervin, who used they/them pronouns, had a hardened look - the clear evidence of their military past. They were known in town as a former military officer with specialized training in demolitions. Nothing could erase that part of their life.\r\n\r\n\"Quite an impressive array of memorabilia here, Rabbi,\" Winston remarked, scanning the room filled with various wartime relics like grenades and medals from Ervin's service days. \"Your friends often tell stories of you proudly showing these off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Careful with those, Detective, they are from my time in the service,\" Ervin replied, with a hint of nostalgia creeping into their tone. \"My friends, they have a way of making things sound more dramatic.\"\r\n\r\nWinston was further intrigued by the hint of gossip he received from one of Ervin's neighbors, \"You know, Otis had been vocal lately. He saw something he shouldn't about Ervin and the synagogue funds. Even said he was planning to go to the authorities.\"\r\n\r\nWith that information, Winston pitched it to Ervin, \"I hear Otis saw something alarming involving you and the synagogue's funds. Heard he was seriously considering going to the authorities.\"\r\n\r\nErvin stiffened noticeably, their cool gaze flickered for a moment. \"Otis talks too much,\" they muttered, a subtle hint of annoyance in their tone.\r\n\r\nJust as he was about to leave, a troubling fact popped back into his mind - Otis. Otis had seen Ervin embezzling funds from the Synagogue and Ervin knew that. Winston marked it down mentally and with a brisk nod to Rabbi Ervin, made his exit. Feeling the sharp gaze of Ervin boring into his back, he needed no further confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe pieces were neatly aligning, like pieces of a puzzle, Winston could see it - But it wasn't his place to tell the story, rather gather it. So with another sigh, he slid into the driver's seat and drove off. The knot in his gut tightened as he pulled away from the synagogue - he knew his work here was far from done.\r\n\r\nWinston pulled the collar of his jacket up and stepped into the freezing cold of the hockey rink. Alone in the rink, he squinted under the heat of the artificial light to read the deserted stands and make out the chalk lines: \"Just a man and his routine...Otis was always here at this time, when no one else was present...So why Otis? Why here?\"\r\n\r\nHours later, Winston found himself wading through the mud and foliage of a nearby hiking trail. He was there to meet Andrew, the local hiking guide, a formally trained Bomb Disposal Technician in the military, and a close friend of Otis. Andrew's hiking business had been losing traction for quite some time. His soldier-like formality was still intact, standing tall despite the fall of his flailing business, which was evident through alarming financial reports showing consistent and increasing negative balance in his accounts.\r\n\r\n\"Right this way, detective.\" Andrew offered, leading him through the dense woods with the authority and precision that only a man with his specialized training would possess. Andrew diligently used his army skills to ensure the safety of hikers from any potential environmental dangers on their guided tours.\r\n\r\n\"Andrew-\" Winston began, striding to keep up with the trained speedwalker, \"I was told you two were close. And you had asked Otis about his insurance policy recently. Care to shed some light on that?\"\r\n\r\nAndrew did not look back as he continued walking. \"Sure did. Otis had been open about his routine. I always knew when he was at the rink or off somewhere else. As for his insurance, he had approached me for advice and later updated it, naming me the beneficiary.\"\r\n\r\nAs they neared Andrew's hiking spot, Winston noticed a military-grade tent with tools, knives, ropes, canned food supplies, and hidden among them, explosives. Andrew's intense secrecy hinted at something more - these were not just regular hiking supplies.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a collection here, Andrew. Comes in handy during your hikes I presume?\" Winston asked casually. Andrew replied with a nod, \"It's an efficient system. Every item serves a purpose.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Winston could probe further, his phone buzzed, indicating a call from the station. \"Just bear with me, Andrew,\" Winston excused himself. Andrew shuffled uncomfortably nearby, sparked a further conversation about Otis' recent insurance update.\r\n\r\nA forensic update from the station linked the lethal grenade to the recent military base theft!\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind if we take this conversation downtown, Andrew?\" Winston turned around. Andrew stood tall, showing no signs of discomfort. He simply nodded and followed Winston, all the while maintaining his usual formal demeanor.",

Andrew:\n   - Motive: Andrew's hiking business was struggling financially, and Otis was the beneficiary of his insurance policy. If Otis were to die, Andrew would stand to gain financially.\n   - Means: Andrew is a former Bomb Disposal Technician, giving him access to explosives.\n   - Opportunity: Andrew was familiar with the hockey rink, as Otis often went there at that time, and he had the opportunity to plant the grenade during one of his visits.\n\nComparing the two suspects, both Ervin and Andrew have motive, means, and opportunity.

Brianna, they had introduced themselves with a nod, their face etched with confusion and a hint of defiance painted an intriguing story. Brianna's pronouns were they/them, and Winston made a mental note to respect that.\r\n\r\n\"So, Brianna, let me understand this,\" Winston began. \"You were discussing matters about a recent project, is that correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Brianna said, a look of challenge in their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And during a recent meeting, you were giving an update on the project's progress?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\n\"I was giving an update,\" Brianna responded, their voice strong and assertive.\r\n\r\nJust then, a mutual acquaintance entered the interview room unexpectedly. A look of concern was etched on his face. \"May I have a moment with Brianna, Detective?\" he asked, pleading with his eyes.\r\n\r\nWinston sighed and nodded, exiting the room. He knew from the acquaintance that not only was Brianna not given the recognition they were considered for, but the decision had come from their acquaintance Roderick – he had outright refused to consider Brianna for recognition. Feeling slighted, they had a heated argument with Roderick.\r\n\r\nWinston knew, Brianna was capable. They had won several awards but their recent activity showed a disturbing pattern. His colleague had told him earlier that Brianna was seen practicing with a pistol at the shooting range. A pistol that matched the murder weapon used.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation led him to a public event. Brianna was present with companions, putting on a friendly face and a casual mask of normalcy. A perfect alibi. But Winston wasn't entirely convinced just yet.\r\n\r\nHe recalled a field policeman questioning Brianna about their recent activities. A brave person confident in their actions, but their world had been recently rocked by disappointment.\r\n\r\nA rival had been recognized instead of them. And Brianna, a competitive person themselves, seemed to be harboring some hard feelings.\r\n\r\nWinston made his way back to the interrogation room. Brianna, his current person of interest, had recently purchased the same kind of pistol used in Roderick's murder. That fact alone made him cautiously alert.\r\n\r\nThis case was far from over, leaving Winston to piece together the complex web of evidence and suspect motives. He sighed, looking across the table at the person in front of him, contemplating the next steps in his investigation.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston sighed as he ran his fingers through his hair looking over the crime scene photographs. The sight of Roderick, a successful entrepreneur, found at a luxury restaurant, oddly felt disheartening to Winston.\r\n\r\nFrom his collected evidence, a pistol registered to Oscar's name was used to shoot Roderick. Winston thought back to the office reports he'd reviewed: Oscar recently losing his job and multiple reports of conflicts at the office. This was a man grappling with a world that was unraveling.\r\n\r\nAs he drove to Oscar's residence for an interview, Winston couldn't shake the image of the domestic dispute reports mentioned by Oscar's children. They fell into a pattern with Oscar's recent purchase of a gun and his prescribed therapy for divorce-related depression.\r\n\r\nOscar greeted Winston in the living room. The house was silent, a portrait of a family interrupted. Winston couldn't help but glance at a family picture on the wall – Oscar and Roderick, faces beaming, their children huddled close.\r\n\r\n\"Been quite a month, hasn't it, Oscar?\" Winston casually inquired.\r\n\r\nOscar nodded, not meeting Winston's eye. \"Sure has been.\"\r\n\r\nWinston got straight to business. \"What led you to buy the gun?\"\r\n\r\nOscar's face shifted slightly, attempting to mask his discomfort. \"Just felt the need to protect my family...I never wanted it to be used...\"\r\n\r\nWinston reeled back. That was unanticipated. \"Interesting...What can you tell me about the event at the restaurant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" Oscar hesitated, his fingers tensed around the armrest. \"We were there for a private party, I'd proposed a toast. Had everyone's attention on me for a while... it was supposed to be a chance for Roderick and I to discuss our divorce...\"\r\n\r\n\"So you two were having marital problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yup. We... I mean, I still loved him very much. But he was going to leave me. I just wanted to talk to him...That’s all.\"\r\n\r\nWinston inclined his head, taking in every word. Here was a man on the brink, a man pushed to the very edge.\r\n\r\n\"Alright, Oscar. I appreciate your cooperation.\" As Winston went for the door, he turned back and looked at Oscar, sadly pondering the tale of a story only half told and yet becoming all too clear to him.",

Another murder landed on his desk. The victim, Roderick. The list of facts pertaining to Brianna, a tenacious teacher suspected to be involved, seemed to be a never-ending stream of potential leads.\r\n\r\nSifting through stacks of evidence, he came across a statement from Roderick, Brianna's boss, refusing to consider her for a promotion at work. Winston placed it on top of the pile as he planned his approach. The next piece of evidence was a statement from a valet at the luxury restaurant. According to the valet, not only did both Brianna and Roderick dine there on the night of the murder, but they were also both seen leaving the restaurant at the same time.\r\n\r\nWinston made his way over to the shooting range. A police report detailed that a pistol Brianna recently purchased and practiced with here was identical to the one used to kill Roderick.\r\n\r\nThe shooting range was winding down for the evening. Winston was able to speak to the range officer, \"So, Brianna's been coming here often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, she's really dedicated. You wouldn't believe it but she's won several competitions here,\" the range officer commented, leading Winston to the lanes where Brianna often practiced.\r\n\r\nWithin his stack of evidence, Winston found a copy of the restaurant's reservation list, confirming Brianna's presence at Classico's that night. More evidence from his stack showed that Brianna had been ambitiously seeking the same promotion at the school she worked, the promotion Roderick instead received.\r\n\r\nHe soon found himself speaking with the restaurant staff. The valet, waitstaff, and even some kitchen staff all recalled seeing Brianna leave the restaurant around the same time as Roderick. Most interestingly, they all bore witness to an argument that Brianna had with Roderick during dinner.\r\n\r\nNext, Winston stopped by the school where Roderick worked. A fellow teacher revealed how deeply disappointed Brianna was when Roderick got the promotion instead of her.\r\n\r\nWith the collected evidence, Winston knew he needed to confront Brianna.\r\n\r\n\"We've talked to the range officer at the shooting range,\" said Winston, meeting Brianna in her classroom.\r\n\r\nBrianna nodded, \"Yes, I spill my frustrations on paper targets, helps me to stay focused.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you dine at Classico's often,\" Winston asked casually.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once every so often,\" replied Brianna, \"I’m a regular there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I’m sure they recognized you the night Roderick was killed,\" Winston said, subtly sliding the copy of the reservations list across the desk.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" Brianna said, cleaning her glasses, \"But isn’t it a little strange that a busy detective like you is asking about dinner plans?”\r\n\r\nWinston shrugged and stood up. \"Well, duty calls. It was nice chatting with you, Brianna.\" Making his leave, Winston thought about all the pieces he had gathered and how they all seemed to point to Brianna.\r\n\r\nWinston was nursing a black coffee and flipping through the case file when the first cracks of dawn speckled the dreary sky. The victim, Roderick, had been a stand-up entrepreneur before he caught a bullet. Roderick had agreed to meet his husband, Oscar, to discuss their divorce plans on the day he died.\r\n\r\n\"Why flee when you're already getting a divorce?\" Winston found himself murmuring to his empty, scarcely lit office. A note from a confidential source in the case file revealed that Oscar had heard from Roderick that he was planning to leave him.\r\n\r\nWinston's musings were interrupted by a phone call. It was Oscar's son, Josh. He cheerfully announced his excitement about the languid summer that lay ahead of him, spent at home. Winston rubbed his eyes, cracked his back, and decided it was time to pay Oscar a visit.\r\n\r\nOscar lived in a modest suburban home. The early morning dew lightly wet the sidewalk and the chill hung in the air. His silver sedan with premium rims was parked in the driveway, just as Oscar's neighbor had mentioned. She'd been seeing their car parked there with the windows down at all times lately. Upon inspection, Winston could see a receipt for a large, black suitcase on the passenger seat. He made a note of it.\r\n\r\nOscar, who used they/them pronouns, looked like a shadow of their former self. Tired eyes, unkempt hair, and the flicker of sadness in their eyes confirmed their ongoing love for Roderick, despite everything. The sad fact that they had been forced to say goodbye to their job a month ago only added to their woe. Their therapist had been supporting them through the divorce-related depression, but with Roderick's sudden demise, things had taken a turn for the worse.\r\n\r\nWinston was offered a cup of coffee while he casually asked Oscar about the night of Roderick's death. Oscar offered up the information that they had proposed a toast at the private party right before Roderick was shot, diverting everyone's attentions momentarily away from the man. After having his fill of the tepid liquid, Winston got up, thanked Oscar for their time, and walked back towards his car.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his shoes crunching the freshly dewed gravel, Winston lit up a cigarette. He drove away eventually, leaving Oscar in his rearview mirror, standing in the doorway. He gave an inward groan thinking about the mountain of paperwork waiting for him at the station.\r\n\r\nIn this mess, a voice echoed in his head, 'Heard Oscar was in therapy. Depression, they said.'\r\n\r\nIt was a long day and Winston was certain, it was going to be a long case.",

They were a regular here, always engrossed in a murder mystery novel, which somehow comforted me in a way. Detective work made you appreciate the mundane things about life.\r\n\r\n\"Autumn,\" I greeted them as I approached, \"how are things?\"\r\n\r\nThey took a moment, reached down into their bag, and pulled out a specific thrilling novel titled \"Perfect Crime\". They glanced up from the book and responded, \"Oh, hello Winston. Just the usual.\"\r\n\r\nI looked down at their book, the title striking a chord, \"This one any good?\"\r\n\r\nAutumn got excited and spoke in vivid detail about the perfect crime plotted in the novel. Their enthusiasm around the theme of crime and the specific details almost perturbed me, but I chose to focus on the dialogue at hand.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned Donald, and how he had plans to head to the bunker. Autumn froze for a moment before returning to their normal composure. \"He trusted you,\" I said, \"would have let you in the bunker.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bunker? Yeah, I know the place. Donald used to talk about it,\" they replied, trying to sound nonchalant. But I could discern a hint of unease in their voice, the knowledge of the bunker and everything that had transpired there appeared to weigh heavy on them.\r\n\r\nAutumn had been in a gang with Donald. Back in the day, they used to own this town, running around and kicking up dust wherever they went. Time moved on, things had changed, but the past lingered in Autumn's fear of their past crimes revealing themselves.\r\n\r\nDonald had confided in me once that he discovered Autumn was still engaging in criminal activities. They had psychic abilities which made them an asset in their criminal past and perhaps, in their current endeavours.\r\n\r\nThe clang of the door brought me back to the café. Autumn had left, the sunshine reflected off their hair as they headed down the street, their murder mystery novel tucked securely under their arm. The people in the café moved again, life resumed while questions circled in my mind. Along with Autumn, I left the café: one looking to uphold justice, and the other, potentially, to evade it.\r\n\r\nWinston walked down the long, subterranean corridor again, guiding his flashlight along the intricately detailed blueprints of the bunker he held in his hands - blueprints that once belonged to the experienced Jay. Once housed in the station, this giant underground maze was a known territory to Jay, of course, but to Winston, it was all foreign.\r\n\r\nHours later, in a makeshift interrogation center in the surface barracks, Winston eyed the familiar face of the missionary, Jay.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen the blueprints, Jay,\" he said simply, watching the other man's face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those?\" Jay replied, a light airiness showing in his reply. \"I spent quite a bit of time down there when I was stationed at this bunker. I could still walk through it blindfolded.\"\r\n\r\n\"And isolated…\" Winston added, his gaze never leaving Jay's face. It was a known fact that the underground bunker locked from the inside and the only two keys existed – one with Donald and the other with Jay. It had been established earlier that Jay and Donald were the only ones inside the fortified bunker during the time of Donald's death.\r\n\r\nJay didn't respond immediately. He looked disinterested, detached. He finally spoke up, \"I guess Donald had started to suspect, huh? He confronted me about it a few days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done some snake handling, haven't you?\" - Winston asked.\r\n\r\nJay chuckled. \"A rite of passage, they call it. Over there in the region with a high snake population, it’s a trial, a blessing, an exorcism.” His tone held a grim, respectful distance.\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, \"I've heard it's common among missionaries to learn about snakebite remedies as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"A living antidote, in case of a bite, that's not common knowledge.\"- Jay answered, leaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Were you aware, Jay,\" Winston began, \"that Donald discovered certain… irregularities?\"\r\n\r\nJay's eyes flickered to Winston's for the first time. \"Irregularities? You mean the smuggling?\" He admitted.\r\n\r\nWinston let the confession hang in the air between them.\r\n\r\n\"I was using the missions to distribute certain substances, that part is true.\" Jay said.\r\n\r\n\"You got trained here, in the bunker. Now you distribute substances, in religious ruse. \" His tone turned pointedly menacing.\r\n\r\nHe leaned in slightly, resting his elbows on the tabletop, \"Discovery of which, Jay, would do a lot more than tarnish a reputation.\"\r\n\r\nJay remained silent, his eyes hardening and body rigid, awaiting the impending threat the detective presented.\r\n\r\nWinston suddenly backed off, taking his notes and exiting the room, leaving Jay alone among his thoughts.",

Something didn't sit right, there was always more to the story than what laid bare, Winston knew this.\r\n\r\nHis latest lead led him to Autumn, the only person Donald would have willingly let inside his survival bunker. Before Donald’s unanticipated retreat to his bunker, he had mentioned his intent to her. The two of them were old acquaintances, sharing a history few knew of, having been in a criminal gang together. Donald was more trusting than most, in fact, Autumn was the only person he would trust when it came to sharing such a secluded spot. His survival bunker was his safe haven, where he was known to retreat when the world became too loud.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was her psychic abilities that drew him in - Autumn did have a knack for knowing things before they happened. Or maybe it was her unique collection of pets she so lovingly tended to. Her pets came with a singular bite, a serpentine collection that few dared to keep. As the sole caretaker of these reptiles, she also had intimate knowledge of their venom, which she knew could prove deadly for Donald.\r\n\r\nEven fewer knew about Autumn's illicit past, dark secrets tangled up with crimes committed years ago; secrets that could have turned disastrous had they been revealed. She feared the consequences that awaited her, fearing her darkest secrets could be unveiled leading to her undoing.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Donald. He had always been a reliable man. A straight shooter who stood up for what he believed was right, even if it got in the way of his personal well-being.\r\n\r\n\"I'd heard a rumor, Autumn,\" started Winston, meeting her outside her reptile enclosure, \"Heard that Donald found out you were back to your old tricks.\"\r\n\r\nAutumn's eyes widened just a tiny bit, almost imperceptible, a reaction only someone with Winston's training would catch.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine his surprise,\" continued Winston, \"down in the bunker alone, knowing his old friend is involved in illegal matters again.\"\r\n\r\nAutumn was silent, staring at the detective with an unreadable expression.\r\n\r\nDonald's fatal allergy to snake venom was not a widely known fact, but one that Autumn was well aware of. Yet, Winston couldn't help but notice, but Autumn's snakes seemed to be unfazed and peaceful in their glass enclosures. Unusual for creatures known for their deadly bite.\r\n\r\nIt struck Winston odd as he mindfully stepped away from the enclosure, keeping Autumn under gaze, \"I hope you aren't up to no good, Autumn, because secrets always find their way out.\"\r\n\r\nWinston took another sip of his lukewarm coffee as he glanced upon the crime scene photos spread out on his desk. Donald's murder was an unusual one, a death by snake venom. He had always thought that underground bunkers were safe; this case was proving him wrong.\r\n\r\nWord on the street was that Jay was quite the character. A missionary, stationed in a region notorious for snakes, missionaries of that region were trained to extract snake venom due to the frequent encounters with these creatures. Winston lit a cigarette as he thought about Jay's training. It seemed unusual for a person of faith, but Winston quickly reminded himself that his job was not to question, rather to understand.\r\n\r\nHe stepped out of his office, coffee in hand, and made his way to the local church. He had arranged to meet Jay there, hoping to gather some insights to this peculiar case.\r\n\r\nJay, who used they/them pronouns, was adjusting the chairs in the church when Winston walked in. As he approached Jay helping with the surroundings, Winston couldn't help but notice the lack of both vocal inflection and changing facial expressions in Jay's greetings. Adding to that, Jay never gave away a hint of their personal life during their meeting, always twisting the conversation towards their missionary tales.\r\n\r\nDespite this, Winston listened attentively. Jay's stories were filled with accounts of handling snakes, a talent they came to master during their time in the region. But as the detective prodded for more personal information, Jay grew restless and god forbid, began to show signs of emotion, expertly redirecting the conversation to a less personal level.\r\n\r\nHome from his meeting with Jay, Winston could not ignore the oddities. Jay was engaging but avoided personal questions. They were in a place full of snakes and had experience handling them. But could handling snakes lead to killing someone?\r\n\r\nA conversation with a certain Father McNulty led to a shocking revelation. Jay was allegedly smuggling drugs during their mission trips. It was a serious accusation, but if true, it could certainly pile on disastrous professional and personal consequences.\r\n\r\nSnakebites remedies were common knowledge among missionaries, it became clear. A darker thought hit Winston, Jay had both access and expertise in handling snake venom--a fact that couldn't be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe final piece to the puzzle came from James, a local grocery-hand who had heard Donald confront Jay about the drugs. It hadn't gone too well. Consequently, this planted a seed of doubt in Winston's mind.\r\n\r\nJay had managed to combine what seemed like an altruistic role of a missionary with illicit activities. But the question remained--did they escalate these actions to murder? Winston stubbed out his cigarette and let out a tired puff of smoke. It would be a long night sorting through his clues.",

Jay:\n   - Motive: Jay was allegedly involved in drug smuggling, and if this was discovered, it could lead to serious consequences. If Donald threatened to expose Jay, it could be a motive for murder.\n   - Means: Jay has experience handling snakes and extracting snake venom due to their missionary work.\n   - Opportunity: Jay had access to Donald, as they were in the same community and had a connection through the church.\n\nComparing the two suspects, both Autumn and Jay have motive, means, and opportunity. However, the opportunity for Autumn seems more direct, as she was the only person Donald would trust enough to let into his survival bunker. On the other hand, Jay had access to Donald through the church, but it's not clear if they had a close enough relationship for Jay to have been invited to the bunker.\n\nANSWER: 2 - Autumn. While both suspects have motive, means, and opportunity, Autumn's opportunity seems more direct, making her the more likely suspect.",

        "context": "In the piercing silence of a New York night, Dwayne's life was brutally ended by a sickle's blade in his own car, launching Detective Winston into a dangerous game of truth and lies with suspects, Anthony and Max.\r\n\r\nWinston was sitting in his dark office, squinting at the collection of photographs from the crime scene. Dwayne’s last ride – the car was a crime scene on its own. A car that belonged to the celebrated art dealer, Max, who had a flair for androgynous fashion and often preferred they/them pronouns.\r\n\r\nThe empty passenger seat next to where Dwayne’s life was taken was a jarring image, the shadow of the uneven coat hanger sticking out like some grotesque sculpture. Only two people on the scene – the deceased and the driver. Max.\r\n\r\nA few nights ago, Winston had seen the two men together at an art exhibition, both appeared engaged in animated conversation before they left together, Dwayne accompanying Max to the car.\r\n\r\nIronically, that very evening at the exhibition, when the discussion began to focus on the art trade, Max excused themselves to use the restroom - a habit they had too often displayed. They were strangely elusive when it came to conversations about the art dealing business. But that wasn’t all. Later that night, someone asked Max about a recent art heist. Startled by this, they quickly switched the conversation to discuss the latest sports news. Discussing the current performance of the local baseball team to be exact.\r\n\r\nPeople attributed Max’s swift exits during trade talks as an eccentricity of an obsessed art lover, but they started becoming suspicious when Max's speedy departure followed the query about the art heist.\r\n\r\nThere's one thing about Artworld - reputation is everything. A tiny ink stain of scandal can become a tremendous blot on an art dealer’s reputation. Public humiliation, such as being caught up in a forgery scandal, could be the death sentence in this high-class world.\r\n\r\nMax knew this, they had always been acutely aware that their hard-earned reputation lay on the basic premise of authenticity. They were proud of their reputation, often boasting about their record of dealing only in authentic pieces. But Dwayne had something else in mind. Word had it that he was preparing to expose one of Max’s famed pieces as a hoax at the next exhibit.\r\n\r\nWinston decided it was high time he paid a visit to Max. The esteemed Art dealer had some hard questions to answer.\r\n\r\nWinston carefully brushed away the shards of glass that crunched under his brown leather brogues. This was not just any car. This was Dwayne's. The same car that Dwayne refused to cede possession of the keys to anyone, save for one...friend. Anthony.\r\n\r\nHe recalled his prior visit to Anthony's art studio. \"The medium is just as important as the message,\" Anthony once told him. Winston, even then, captivated by the sculptural sequences of religious allegory, all lovingly carved by the man himself with a pottage of tools, including their shared favorite -- a sickle.\r\n\r\nAnthony had recently poured his beliefs and faith into his work, passionately emphasizing his religious themes. His disquieting fervor was evident in every sculpture, each bearing an ominous sickle, a tool he had been using for the last five years.\r\n\r\nWinston shuffled through his notes and found the transcript of a sermon given by Anthony, where he vehemently said the non-believers were threats. A veiled offensive, inspired by Dwayne, who never refrained from criticizing Anthony's religious art nor his belief systems, a matter that Anthony took immense offense to.\r\n\r\nAnthony, no stranger to Dwayne's criticism, had requested a meeting with Dwayne. \"Dwayne,\" he had written, \"it's urgent. We meet by your car. You know the place.\" Anthony had the keys to the car belonging to the man he disagreed with most, the man whose disbelief became a source of disdain for him.\r\n\r\nWinston remembered the sobering reality --- he now stood at the very location of their meet. Dwayne's car. A discovery that was both alarming and fascinating, considering Anthony was, to his knowledge, the only other person who had access to it.\r\n\r\nBack at his office, Winston eyed the order forms, spread wide on his disheveled desk. Sickle after sickle being ordered in retrospect, all intended for Anthony's art projects.\r\n\r\n\"Why sickles? Isn't it a bit risqué in these times, Anthony?\" Winston once asked him. Anthony merely laughed it off, avoiding the question. Today, as he pieced together the facts of Dwayne's demise, the laugh was rather disquieting.\r\n\r\nWinston blew out a tired breath, tapping his pen against a stack of papers. This case was becoming a complex labyrinth, and Anthony, once just an artist fueled by his faith, was slowly emerging as a puzzle piece of bewildering proportions.",

Max:\n   - Motive: While Max and Dwayne had a professional relationship, there's no clear evidence suggesting a personal grudge or motive for Max to kill Dwayne. However, Max's evasiveness when discussing the art trade and the recent art heist could be seen as suspicious.\n   - Means: Max did not have direct access to the weapon, a sickle, as it was Anthony's tool of choice.\n   - Opportunity: Max was present at the crime scene, but there's no evidence suggesting they had access to Dwayne's car or the keys.\n\nGiven the information provided, Anthony seems to have a stronger case for motive, means, and opportunity. While Max may have had reasons to be evasive about the art trade and the heist, these do not directly link them to Dwayne's murder.

Max ran a popular art dealership in town, claiming to deal with artifacts too, and his reputation had charmed many art enthusiasts, including Dwayne.\r\n\r\nUpon knocking, the door creaked open. Winston found himself in a large living space, filled with exquisite pieces of art, including a rather unique sickle, which was oddly intriguing.\r\n\r\n\"Max?\" Winston called out, taking care not to disturb the artifacts around him.\r\n\r\nMax returned from another room, a pleased grin on his face, his eyes kindling with pride,\" Ah, detective, welcome to my humble abode.\"\r\n\r\nMax was a known art dealer who wasn't just after profit but cherished the art of curating a meaningful collection. From Winston's observation, Max appeared to be highly concerned about his reputation in this field.\r\n\r\nWhen Winston asked, \"Did Dwayne visit you last night?”, from the corner of his eye he noticed a flicker of unease cross Max’s face. Max hesitated before answering, \"Yes, Detective. He wanted to take a look at my collection... he had a soft spot for historical farming artifacts.\"\r\n\r\nAs they chatted, Max admitted to giving Dwayne a ride afterward as Dwayne was his guest, and thought it only right to drive him back. Dwayne was seated in the passenger's seat of Max's car, he had said. It was in this same car where Dwayne's lifeless body was found later.\r\n\r\n\"So it was just the two of you going to the car?\", Winston clarified, to which Max nodded, confirming that he was last seen with Dwayne heading towards the car.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion continued, Winston learnt from Max about an upcoming exhibit, where Dwayne planned to expose an inauthentic artifact in Max's collection, something that threatened Max’s reputation.\r\n\r\nOn leaving, Winston couldn't help but echo the words of an old mentor. In a world where reputation is synonymous with one's identity, public humiliation would surely be a blow to anyone's individuality.\r\n\r\nWith that he exited, leaving a rather perturbed Max behind him, contemplating the implications.\r\n\r\nWinston found himself standing in the midst of Anthony's gallery. The room was a silent symphony of colors and emotions, none of which were gold. But gold was the color he was concerning himself with today. Anthony's housekeeper had testified that she found gold paint on their clothes after their various trips, an unusual finding considering none of their displayed art contained any hint of the metallic hue.\r\n\r\nHe stepped out to speak with the gallery owner, his heavy boots echoing slightly in the hushed rooms. \"They use gold paint?\" Winston asked, waving a test report he had from Anthony's housekeeper.\r\n\r\n\"No, not ever in their career. Anthony's palette is more primary,\" the gallery owner stated, looking rather puzzled.\r\n\r\nAfter a short nod, Winston tucked away the paper, and left the gallery. His next stop in the long journey would be to confront Anthony themselves. Anthony had earlier on requested a meeting with Dwayne. They decided to use this unusual request as leverage, they agreed now to meet Winston by Dwayne's car, a location they knew well since they had keys to it. They pulled out their phone to arrange this unusual meeting.\r\n\r\nAnthony looked a bit out of place amongst the urban landscape, amongst the shining cars. Their hair was a wild mane and colors smudged their skin artistically. A keychain, bulky and jingling with keys, sat by their side.\r\n\r\n\"I had to pick up some of Dwayne's things\", Anthony said, hand unconsciously stroking the keychain. \"His woman couldn’t do it, she's a wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had keys to his car?\" Winston prompted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, we were friends after all,\" Anthony replied, confirming their synaptic tie to Dwayne's automobile.\r\n\r\nWinston decided to take a different approach for the kind of question that lay heavy on his mind. \"Dwayne didn't share your religious beliefs, did they?\" He said, more of a statement than a question.\r\n\r\nAnthony's face twisted, their features hardened. \"No, he didn't, the fool was way off the path. He never got my art, my sermons. I've often stated in my preachings that the nonbelievers like him were threatening the sanctity of our path.\"\r\n\r\nAnthony looked uncomfortable when they realized what they had just said, and they tried to compose themselves. \"He needed help, that’s why I wanted to meet him. Sure, I was deeply offended by his criticism, but that doesn't make my concern any less valid.\"\r\n\r\n\"To convince him about your beliefs?\" Winston posed, a touch of humanity in his tone.\r\n\r\n\"No, to make him understand my art!\" Anthony's voice was emphatic. But they didn’t admit to painting with gold.\r\n\r\n\"There were disagreements then?\" Winston asked, almost rhetorically.\r\n\r\nA deep sigh rasped out from Anthony's mouth. \"Yes, often. Unfortunately, I was unable to win him over.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked down at their hands, the same hands that relentlessly splashed beautiful, and often disturbing, illusions onto canvas. And then a grim realization reflected on their face, a bitter parting comment reminding them of the deep offense Dwayne’s criticism might have caused. The open space around Dwayne's car echoed with the ringing silence-the paradoxical sound of an artist remorseful.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it doesn’t matter now.\" Anthony got up to leave, a sad brush of reality tinted their voice.\r\n\r\nThe person was an artist, devoted to their spiritual path to the point of obsession. But enough to commit a murder? Winston wondered, the many pieces of this puzzle yet to find their right place.",

Anthony:\n   - Motive: Anthony had a deep religious and artistic obsession that was often criticized by Dwayne. This criticism could have been a source of deep offense for Anthony, and they expressed their concern about Dwayne's criticism in their conversation with Detective Winston.\n   - Means: Anthony had access to gold paint, as it was found on their clothes and they were known to use it in their art.

        "context": "In the hushed sanctity of an ancient temple, the seemingly innocuous corkscrew turns deadly, plunging Detective Winston into a maze of deceit with only two suspects - Xochitl and Martin.\r\n\r\nWinston found himself outside the temple where Olivia's body was discovered. He was there to have another interview with Martin who, under more normal circumstances, would be found reading alone during his breaks. Martin, who used they/them pronouns, was already waiting at the meeting point, their eyes fixed on the pages of a worn novel. Their previous interactions with law enforcement had accustomed them to this type of meeting. Indeed, Martin was a suspected serial killer, having been investigated in several similar cases, none of which were ever concluded definitively.\r\n\r\nStanding just inside the entrance, Winston looked at Martin, the solitude-seeking individual currently immersed in a book, a common sight both at the temple during their regular visits for deliveries and elsewhere. Martin, preferring solitary tasks and overlapping their lunch hours with the team's break time, seemed at ease with the solitude.\r\n\r\nClearing his throat, Winston begun, \"Martin, I understand you've been making deliveries for quite some time now. On the day of Olivia's murder, you were making a delivery to the temple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's true,\" Martin lowered their book and met the detective's gaze. “Olivia’s package was in my load,\" they admitted, their voice controlled and steady.\r\n\r\nA silence fell upon the room, underscored by the emptiness of the temple. It started to sink in for Winston that Martin was the only person here at the temple when Olivia was murdered, and the circumstances made them look like more than just someone due to do their rounds.\r\n\r\nThe silence was finally broken as Martin returned to their solitary activity, unfazed by the heavy atmosphere. Their continuous composure, even in the face of a murder investigation, gave cause to unease. Olivia bore a striking resemblance to Martin's previous alleged victims, which made Winston wonder if this was indeed the work of the same suspect. With a heavy heart, Winston retreated, leaving Martin with their quiet solitude and an unresolved suspicion.\r\n\r\nDetective Winston strolled into the ancient temple, a hallowed ground gone silent. The only room disturbed was the small, private chamber, where Xochitl conducted her tarot readings. The place was still thick with incense and wine, the latter spilled and sour.\r\n\r\nOlivia attended Xochitl's tarot reading the day she was murdered. Olivia had always been a consistent presence, never missing a session, always there, purposefully disturbing Xochitl and her sister... a fact which Winston had been made aware of.\r\n\r\nAppointment with Xochitl for an interview was set. Petite woman with a weathered yet kind face greeted him at the entrance. She was regarded as the temple's best tarot reader and she wore it like a badge, conducting her readings with sincerity and attention to detail.\r\n\r\n\"Detective, Olivia did always say she'd ruin my sister's life...\" Xochitl said her voice barely above the whisper.\r\n\r\nHeard about the threats. Even more, Xochitl had found evidence of Olivia's plans. Yet Xochitl loved her sister deeply. Wouldn’t let anything hurt her sister. Her protector, her safe harbor, her friend.\r\n\r\n\"I thought she was bluffing... just harassment. But I found her notebook... she was actually planning to destroy my sister,\" said Xochitl, her voice sullen.\r\n\r\nThe day Olivia was murdered, Xochitl and her sister had had an argument with Olivia. At the temple. Spiteful words thrown around like daggers. A disturbing element in the peaceful temple environment. Wine helped, they said; it added an element of relaxation to the readings. There was always a corkscrew on the table. It was just... there.\r\n\r\n\"Today was like any other day. The tarot reading was going well, till Olivia showed up. Always tried to disturb us, hurt my sister,\" her voice filled with sorrow and worry.\r\n\r\n\"The tarot did warn of a danger... I didn't know it would be this way,\" she said looking away, eyes filled with horror and regret.\r\n\r\nWinston thanked her for her time and left the temple grounds. This case was far from clear, and every fact had to be combed through. How had it come to this? Traces of threat, a protective sister, an uncompromising victim… he had a long analysis ahead.",

        "context": "In the hushed sanctity of an ancient temple, the seemingly innocuous corkscrew turns deadly, plunging Detective Winston into a maze of deceit with only two suspects - Xochitl and Martin.\r\n\r\nWith Olivia's murder still fresh, Winston found himself at the local temple, the gusty air bringing an ominous chill. Instagram photos and notes, discovered by Xochitl, declared that Olivia had intentions to seriously harm Xochitl's sister and ruin her life. Olivia's actions had extended to constant harassment, as per statements from numerous local residents.\r\n\r\nThat's when Winston set his eyes on Xochitl for the first time. A town local, known for conducting regular Tarot readings, they was known to have a strong inclination towards rituals and esoteric practices. The temple was often their stage for spiritual enlightenment, which required the uncorking of ritualistic wine bottles with a trusty corkscrew, a habit they had grown accustomed to. Xochitl's style, a blend of androgynous elegance and eclectic charm, reflected their non-binary identity, and their dark, expressive eyes sparkled with an air of mystique.\r\n\r\nWinston approached them while they were meticulously packing away their Tarot cards, their voice barely rising above the rustling of the cards. \"Are you always this involved in your...ritual practices?\" he asked, noting their obvious devotion. \"Yes,\" they responded, \"It has become a part of me, something very close to my heart.\"\r\n\r\nWinston paused before asking about their trips. Xochitl's expression faltered a bit as they looked at him, then away. \"They happen now and then,\" they said calmly, swiftly changing the subject to the next upcoming spiritual gathering. Winston noted that their trips were far from listed on their nearby calendar, a fact he filed away on his internal docket.\r\n\r\nConversation shifted, and Xochitl showered their sister with affection. They shared a story of a recent conflict Olivia had with their sister, one laced with threats to ruin her life. The passion with which Xochitl narrated the story was palpable.\r\n\r\nAs Winston was exiting, he caught sight of various trinkets littered around Xochitl's space. A glance at one of the suitcase tags confirmed it had an origin from a foreign country. He recalls how the locals often gossiped about Xochitl bringing back a new trinket or souvenir from each trip they made, adding to their ever-growing collection. It was the same country that matched one of Xochitl's passport stamps -- a souvenir from their unmarked trips perhaps. The details of their travels remained shrouded in mystery, with Xochitl deftly avoiding deeper conversations about these.\r\n\r\n\"I'll speak with you soon, Xochitl,\" Winston affirmed as he left, feeling a complex web of possibilities dissecting in his mind. Curious about the tie between Xochitl, their mysterious trips, the souvenirs and the tragic murder, he was determined to peel back the layers of ambiguity surrounding this case.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the unfortunate event at the local temple, Detective Winston flipped through the details of the victims. A familiar sense of dread had come to accompany the name of Olivia – similar to the other women whose investigations he had compiled over time, yet still distinctly unique. It spurred the creeping sensation of a suspected serial killer at large.\r\n\r\n“There’s something about this delivery guy…” he murmured, pulling a file, filled with suspicions, on Martin, a package delivery driver. Winston had previously handled several investigations related to Martin for similar incidents, but they had all gone cold. “Is it déjà vu?”\r\n\r\nHe shuffled through the documents in Martin's file. The delivery man, as per his employer’s statement, made regular visits to the temple for his deliveries, which interestingly enough, had also happened on the fateful day Olivia was found dead. Today, he was scheduled to deliver a package to none other than Olivia herself.\r\n\r\nAs Winston read further, he scratched the stubble on his chin, remembering a tidbit he had come across in one of the previous investigations. Martin had this... peculiar method of opening packages, using a corkscrew. Yes, a corkscrew of all things. And that was a part of his regular equipment, he would carry it with him every day.\r\n\r\nQuirkily, during an early afternoon surveillance encounter upon one of his visits at the temple on the very day of the murder, Martin was seen carrying his odd tool, the corkscrew.\r\n\r\n\"It's ironic, don't you think?\" One of his fellow officers had remarked dryly. \"Our potential serial killer and his corkscrew.\"\r\n\r\nWinston refrained from comment, remembering the discrepancies that had led those cases to grow cold. Several of them were left inconclusive - always touch and go - with evidence that went around in circles but never quite completed the picture.\r\n\r\nAs he went through his notes, Winston noticed another uncanny resemblance - Olivia was quite similar in appearance to the past victims; young, brunette, and striking eyes.\r\n\r\nFingers drumming against the cool, polished surface of his wooden desk, Winston reviewed Martin’s work log. It noted the driver was prescheduled enough to have him at the temple around the suspected time of Olivia’s demise that day. With furrowed brows, he made note of the temple's solitary condition during the time - not another soul around.\r\n\r\nToo many coincidences and not enough clarity. Winston sighed heavily, clicking his pen shut. The more things unravelled, the more they seemed convoluted. But he knew better than to pinpoint connections. For now, it was about gathering facts, no matter how cryptic.",

Beside the main floor was a separate storage area, cleverly concealed and invisible from the sales floor - tucked away in a quiet corner where no customer could see. Salesmen were bustling about, attempting to close deals and lure in unsuspecting customers. His gaze settled on a particular individual, who was rather keenly explaining the mileage of a specific model to a customer: Miles, who wore their hair in a short, stylish manner and had a collection of eclectic, colorful scarves draped over their outfit.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Miles,\" Winston greeted in his stern tone, interrupting the technical talk about mileage.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sir. I'm deep in a conversation,\" they said, not looking up from the customer.\r\n\r\n\"I believe this is more important,\" Winston replied, flashing his badge.\r\n\r\nMiles made an excuse to the customer and led Winston toward the hidden storage room, away from the prying eyes of the staff and customers. Entering the secretive area that no other employee had set foot in, Miles seemed visibly unnerved, surrounded by nothing but stacks of tires and car parts.\r\n\r\n\"Is there something wrong, detective?\" They asked, subtly glancing at the locked door behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Miles, I want to talk to you about Sophie.

We've had our issues politically too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm aware,\" Winston said curtly, noticing Miles turning defensive.\r\n\r\n\"Sophie possessed evidence against you, she found out about money laundering carried out through this dealership, perhaps?\" Winston probed.\r\n\r\nMiles shifted uncomfortably; their complexion changed and they cast their eyes down nervously. \"I...I don't know what you're talking about, Detective.\"\r\n\r\nWinston sternly replied, \"Sophie planned to reveal these illegal acts. You knew it, didn’t you? She was about to expose your whole operation.”\r\n\r\n\"Anyone would want to protect their livelihood, Detective,” retorted Miles, avoiding Winston's piercing gaze.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Winston said calmly assessing the situation, \"It seems no one else knows what you do in this storage room Miles.\"\r\n\r\n“Well, it's my dealership, my storage. Do I need an audience now?\" Miles retorted, frustration creeping into their voice.\r\n\r\nDeciding to change gears a bit, Winston asked, \"Say, Miles, you sponsor anyone in Sophie's campaign?\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually I do, I have been secretly financing a competing candidate in Sophie's campaign.\" Revealed Miles with a mischievous grin, sensing no immediate danger.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, hedging your bets, are we?\" Winston concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said, ending the conversation. He finished up his lukewarm coffee, thanked Miles for their time, and walked out of the concealed storage room, leaving Miles behind in the stuffy room of tires and car parts.\r\n\r\nAs he meandered through the dealership, Winston thought about what Miles had said and not said. He stepped out into the parking lot, squinting against the harsh afternoon sun. He had a mystery to solve, and every lead mattered.\r\n\r\nWinston took another sip from his coffee cup as he shuffled through the files, his tired eyes narrowing on the name Willard, the initial suspect for the recent wrestling ring homicide. Sophie's death had hit the community like a brick wall, and the press swarmed around it like flies.\r\n\r\nSophie, a champion wrestler, was shot in the ring while performing one of her signature moves. The chaos of that night was still reported in the tabloids, time seemed to have stopped, and the investigation was now up to him.\r\n\r\nSophie had falsely accused Willard of malpractice, however, she won the court case. It was an incident that was the talk of the town. The accusations, though false, were ratified by court, leaving Willard's career on thin ice. Winston remembered Willard's hands shaking at the courthouse, his eyes burning with something Winston could not quite pinpoint.\r\n\r\nSpotting Willard's front-row wrestling event ticket in the collected evidence file, Winston knew he had been there right at the heart of the event. It was well known that mandatory check-ins were required for attendees and part of Willard’s check-in document showed his presence at the entrance of the arena, confirming his presence at that fateful match.\r\n\r\nThe interviews had a common thread - Willard frequented the wrestling matches. Winston had found the receipts and tickets for each event annotated in Willard's handwriting; it was an unquestionable fact.\r\n\r\nDr. Willard's profile drew Winston's attention. His career required him using protective tools like support belts and gloves, but also a familiarity with the human anatomy that would be advantageous in a wrestling match. It was especially Willard’s second career—his military background—that caught Winston’s eye. Winston had heard about Willard's long career in the army. The firearm training he got there pulled him back to the murder.\r\n\r\nPoring over reports again, Winston recalled that Willard carried a firearm for protection. The firearm was engraved into the case's backbone, another undeniable fact that Winston had to grapple with.\r\n\r\nHe took a deep breath and decided to pay Willard a visit.\r\n\r\nMeeting Willard at his office, Winston perched himself on the edge of the chiropractic table, looking at the protective gloves and belts hanging on the wall, it was evident that his practice required these safety tools. Winston could see Willard's tension, the hint of uncontrollable worry seeping from his face. He handed over his business card to Willard.\r\n\r\n\"So, Willard, you were at the wrestling match the night Sophie was shot?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\nWillard nodded, \"Yes, I was there... I... I usually go to watch the matches. I had a front-row ticket.\"\r\n\r\nWinston opened his notepad, marking it down. \"The court case, it was... tough on you, wasn't it?\" He asked.\r\n\r\nWillard swallowed, nodding again without a word.\r\n\r\nWinston stood up to leave, passing a quick glance over the firearms manual lying on the shelf, and pocketed his notepad. He didn't know if he had all the answers, but he was determined to find the truth.",

        "context": "In the ominous arena of a wrestling ring, Sophie's life was unexpectedly cut short by the deadly crack of a pistol; now it's up to grizzled Detective Winston to interrogate suspects Willard and Miles, unmasking the murderer among them.\r\n\r\nWinston tapped his finger gently on the folder marked 'Sophie,' his deep-set eyes brooding over the troubling police files. The latest files had pointed him towards the infamous suspect, Willard, who used they/them pronouns and had a quiet, unassuming presence.\r\n\r\nHis first priority was a discussion with Willard's family. Winston sensed a tension within the household, their nervous smiles barely managing to disguise the concern emanating from their eyes. Their excessive cordiality did not help to ease Winston’s suspicions either.\r\n\r\n\"One moment they are here, the next, they're disappeared... Always been a person of mystery, our Willard,\" said one of the family members, echoing the general sentiment. Winston committed to memory the statement about Willard's irregular attendance and early departures from family events.\r\n\r\nIn one conversation, the family mentioned an episode from Willard's past serving in the military. The proud march, the calling to arms and patriotic chants echoed with a fleeting gleam in their eyes, tracing back the glory days when Willard underwent firearm training. A chill began to creep into Winston, but he pushed it back, refusing to draw any conclusions just yet.\r\n\r\nThe family shared how they were constantly trying to get in touch with Willard, their frantic attempts being met with obstinate silence and evasions. A phone filled with incoming calls from various family members had apparently been a common sight for Willard, but they purposefully avoided their calls.\r\n\r\nIrrefutable evidence was uncovered in the case file: Sophie had falsely accused Willard of malpractice. Despite this, Sophie's persistence won her the court case against Willard. The court controversially ratified the baseless malpractice accusations, resulting in the termination of Willard's work license.\r\n\r\nLife had not been kind to Willard post that trial. Once a cherished figure in the town, they now used robust protective tools in their new, mundane job. The heavy, clinical gloves sparkling immaculately under the sterile clinic lights were perhaps the last vestiges of their once illustrious career.\r\n\r\nOne of Willard’s former military buddies had noted their self-protection apparatus, a gun safely secured away in accordance with the local laws. No one could fault a person, especially one trained in the military, for taking the necessary precautions to secure the safety of their own home, could they?\r\n\r\nWith the stage set precisely as Sophie desired, she dug Willard's downfall deep and mercurial. However, it was clear to Winston that Sophie's claims in court were indeed more hype than truth. It was a meticulously orchestrated theatre for public consumption and Sophie was the skilled puppeteer.\r\n\r\nAs he navigated through the complicated tales of Willard's case, he couldn’t shake off the eerie feeling that Willard's peripheral existence carried more depth than what met the eye. But jumping to conclusions was never Winston's style. For now, all the facts and tales added another layer to the mysterious puzzle that is Willard.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of a wrestling event, Winston was analyzing the chaos that had unraveled. The area, now void of its once fervent spectators, was shrouded in silence broken only by the solemn presence of Sophie's lifeless body.\r\n\r\nSophie, ever the ambitious woman, had divided her time between her political career where she was pitted against the likes of Miles, and other interests - in this case, wrestling. Her body in the wrestling ring lay in stark contrast to her living self in Winston's memory, where he last saw her in a bustling car dealership owned by Miles. This same dealership was now part of a growing crime scene.\r\n\r\nMiles was known as the dealer that could talk anyone into buying anything. His charm had woven him into all sorts of events and situations, some more suspect than others. One such situation led to a wrestling match between him and Sophie, his main political opponent. The high energy from the crowd that night still hung in the air, their wild cheers a testament to the fierce competition that had just taken place.\r\n\r\nWhen Winston visited Miles's car dealership, he was greeted with the sight of glossy sportscars, family sedans, and even a few police issue vehicles. The latter was part of Miles's specialty - police vehicles equipped with pistols, ready to serve the needs of law enforcement.\r\n\r\nWinston turned a critical eye to Miles's inventory, prompting him to say, \"Quite the setup you got here,\" as he made his way into Miles’s office for a meeting. The layers of obfuscation that Miles attempted with his cheerful demeanor did nothing to dissuade Winston from the degree of Miles's unease.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know, business has been good,\" Miles deflected.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Winston returned, \"Especially when you're financing a competing candidate behind Sophie's political campaign.\" Surprised by Winston's directness, Miles stuttered momentarily before feigning indifference.\r\n\r\nStruggling to move on, Miles attempted a change of topic by focussing on Sophie's ability to wrestle both physically and politically. \"You must have seen her wrestle, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, indeed,\" Winston replied, catching the guilt that attempted to hide behind Miles' uneasy laughter.\r\n\r\nWinston knew that while Sophie occasionally wrestled for sport, she also wrestled with the truth. The evidence she collected was slowly uncovering illegal activities linked back to Miles's car dealership; specifically, money laundering. Despite the recent tragic events, she still had plans to publicly expose his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences at the wrestling ring and the car lot were definitely cause for speculation, considering the complex relationship between Miles and Sophie. Sophie's bodyguard had recently bought a police vehicle from Miles's dealership, a purchase that led him to discover a pistol, identical to the one found at the scene of Sophie's death. A question hung in the air - did Miles know about it?\r\n\r\nAs Winston excused himself from the meeting, he reflected upon Miles’s desperation to protect his reputation and livelihood. A formidable adversary like Sophie was certainly not a threat Miles could simply ignore. With each passing moment, it was becoming increasingly clear that this was just the beginning of their investigation.",

        "context": "In the quiet solitude of a local library, Philip is found shockingly murdered with a barbed wire, leaving Detective Winston with the arduous task of sifting truth from alibis of the two main suspects, Hugo and Maria.\r\n\r\nStepping into the library, a sea of hushed whispers and tiptoeing patrons, detective Winston began his appointment with Hugo. Navigating his way through the maze of bookshelves and study cubicles, he found the man seated in a corner, engrossed in a tangle of wires and knobs. Hugo was a sound engineer. The smorgasbord of tools and wires – even a wild-looking barbed one often used in some peculiar sound gigs-, extending around him served as a testament to his profession and the variety of venues he worked in.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hugo?\" Winston interrupted, his voice barely a notch above a whisper. Hugo nodded, eyelids still glued to his work. \"I'm detective Winston. I hope I'm not interrupting,\" he casually commented, glancing at the array of wiring tangled in the engineer's hands.\r\n\r\nHe took notice of the barbed wire amongst the mix. A trace of unease settled in the back of his mind as he recalled the crime scene images: Philip, lifeless in the library-turned-crime scene, surrounded by scattered books and barbed wire.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Hugo paused his work and leaned back, engaging the detective. Hugo mentioned a sound engineering job he was working on at the library at the time of Philip's murder. His work, he explained, often brought him to quiet, empty venues like this after dark, be it a library, an amphitheater, or something else entirely, each requiring specific types of wires and tools, barbed wire included.\r\n\r\n\"Bit of an unusual pick, isn't it?\" Winston tried to sound nonchalant.\r\n\r\nHugo chuckled, revealing a collection of rare and unusual wires he'd acquired as part of his professional routines. He casually referred to his atypical collection as an occupational hazard, barbed wire included.\r\n\r\nThe conversation somehow segued to Hugo's family, particularly his brother. \"He's not the responsible, betting kind,\" Hugo sighed, mentioning a lost gamble that cost his brother significantly. \"Between you and me,\" he leaned in to confide, \"Philip could be pretty aggressive when it came to his debts. In fact, he was known to resort to physical violence to get his way, a tendency that worried me always.\"\r\n\r\nDetective Winston couldn't help but ask, \"Did you confront him about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but...\" Hugo hesitated before confessing a private phone call he overheard between Philip and his brother. Philip, as per Hugo, had not minced words in expressing his threats.\r\n\r\nWith his booked time slot over, Hugo readied to leave. Winston noticed the lights around them were already shutting down. The library often stayed vacant during Hugo's setup and takedown sessions, he mentioned nonchalantly.\r\n\r\nAs Winston left the dusky library, he contemplated the quiet bulk of sound equipment Hugo had in tow, wires of all sorts jingling together. It left a disquiet in his gut that he couldn't quite explain. But as a detective, he was trained to never jump to conclusions. After all, in a murder investigation, everything and everyone was a piece in the puzzle until proven otherwise.\r\n\r\nAs Winston walked into Maria's salon, he was overrun by the smell of hair products and freshly brewed coffee. The salon itself was bustling, filled with happy chatter and the occasional hum of hair dryers. He was taken in by the sight of Maria, who used they/them pronouns and had a vibrant, eclectic style that reflected their personality, working diligently on a customer's hair, using an abundance of sharp tools, from scissors to razors.\r\n\r\n\"Maria?\" called Winston.\r\n\r\nThey looked up, their eyes catching the sheen of the barbed hairpins on their tray. They looked dangerously sharp - almost eerily similar to barbed wire.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's me! Can I help you?\" Maria responded.\r\n\r\n\"Just have a few questions,\" Winston muttered.\r\n\r\nMaria's salon, open until 10 pm every evening, was bustling. As he waited for Maria to finish with their current client, he couldn't help but notice a large unidentifiable bag resting in the corner.\r\n\r\nMaria then joined Winston, washing their hands before sitting across from him. \"Detective, isn't it?\" they said, having picked up on his official demeanor.\r\n\r\n\"I often see you at the library,\" Winston started, hoping his observation could break the ice.\r\n\r\nMaria's eyes twinkled as they answered, \"Yes, that's true. I find it soothing to visit the library after I close the salon at 10 pm. It's open till then, making it a perfect addition to my schedule.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on, revealing Maria's deep connection with the library—it came to the point where they became one of its registered trustees and were trusted with its key.\r\n\r\nLater, the conversation shifted to their closing activities at the salon. It didn't take long for Winston to realize the purpose of the large unidentifiable bag. After closing, Maria would routinely transport this bag to their car trunk, which they conveniently parked just outside.\r\n\r\n\"I heard from a neighbor that they've seen you cleaning your car in the parking lot after midnight,\" Winston remarked.\r\n\r\nMaria simply nodded, unfazed. \"Yes, I tidy up my car after a long day at the salon. I usually carry my cleaning supplies in there—it's easier to keep things clean on the go.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation then took a darker turn. Winston disclosed the tragic news of Philip's demise—he had been found murdered in the library. His time of death coincidentally coincided with Maria's usual visits. The revelation hung heavy in the air, but Winston, true to his role, kept his thoughts in check. His job was to collect information. Deductions were left to the reader.\r\n\r\nAfter expressing his gratitude to Maria, Winston has left them to continue their work. Retreating to his car, he began considering his next line of inquiry, Philip's murder fresh on his mind.",

Philip, a library frequenter, was dead, with dire circumstances suggesting a gruesome murder. The weapon, a coil of barbed wire, unusual for sure. As he walked into the salon, he saw a middle-aged woman, Maria with a multitude of barbed hairpins reflecting ominously under the lights. She was working away with a pair of scissors, her nimble fingers managing both the razor and the various hairpins with the dexterity of an artist.\r\n\r\n\"Maria?\" Winston asked.\r\n\r\nCaught off guard, Maria looked up, her eyes wide in surprise. \"Yes, detective, can I help you with something?\" she answered, never pausing her delicate dance of grooming. She clicked her scissors, moved on to her razor, then her infamous collection of barbed hairpins, all with the practiced ease of someone in her profession for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"I hear you've been doing this for over fifteen years?\" he asked, partially making small talk, partially feeling out the woman in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Sixteen years, next Tuesday.\" She replied, her gaze deliberately focused on her current client's head.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a long time...\" Winston said, thoughtful. \"You ever do hair for a fellow called Philip?\"\r\n\r\nMaria paused for a moment, her eyes downcast. \"Yes, I did his hair once. He's the one found in the library, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Winston nodded, \"I heard about your usual evening strolls to the library. The one open late till 10 pm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, it's quiet, peaceful. They don't mind if I bring my coffee inside. I even have a key, just in case I lose track of time and it's closing,\" Maria disclosed.\r\n\r\n\"I see. How about Robert? Phillip's fiance. He been here, recently?\" Winston changed the subject.\r\n\r\nMaria swallowed and cleared her throat, stepping away from her customer to face Winston. \"Yes, he came... to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"To talk about the wedding, or about that time in high school where you confessed your love to him before he proposed to Philip?\" Winston probed.\r\n\r\nMaria averted her eyes, \"About the wedding... but, yes, we also brought up the past. I've been in love with Robert since high school, and I've been secretly carrying that love for years, you know.\"\r\n\r\nWinston observed Maria. Things certainly aren't always as they seem, he thought, as she returned to her client, her barbed hairpins dancing in the slightly unsettling light. The fact that the time of Philip's death aligned eerily with Maria's usual library visit was an added layer of unease. \"Well, Robert's supposed to marry Philip soon, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but things aren't always as they seem, detective.\" Maria's voice held an edge as she responded, her gaze being both hurt yet defiant, hinting at a deeper tale yet to unravel.\r\n\r\nBlowing off steam, jumping from coffee shop to coffee shop, Winston was back on track, unanswered questions regarding Philip's mysterious murder bouncing in his mind. Known for his capacity for violence to get what he wanted, Philip had a reputation; ironically, barbed wire, his common form of conflict resolution, had been the weapon.\r\n\r\nThe detectives at the precinct were all a twitter about the eccentric sound technician, Hugo. Out of all potential suspects they'd drawn in, one thing about Hugo was blinking on Winston's radar. Not once had any colleague, friend or customer ever been invited to his personal studio where Hugo spent most of their time. They were protective of their private space, it seemed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm detouring to Hugo's office,\" Winston informed his partner as he made a left turn.\r\n\r\nThe professional layout of Hugo's studio stood testament to their skills. Winston noticed the different categories of wires neatly stowed away, labeled by type. Spools of common wires were neatly packed, then his gaze floated towards an unusual collection of unique wires, barbed wire included, labeled 'personal collection'. He stroked one with his gloved fingers, lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"Hugo,\" Winston called for their attention, \"This is some impressive collection. Not everyone works with barbed wire in a sound system, huh?\" Hugo's smile was gentle, \"I just like to keep my wire knowledge versatile,\" they shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you missed out on this year's industry conference,\" Winston inquired casually.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Conferences are not my cup of tea,\" Hugo chuckled, \"Too much show and too little know. I prefer focusing on the actual job, here in my studio.\"\r\n\r\nCasual chat moved reflective as Winston asked about Philip, \"What about Philip? Ever get into a formal tussle with him?\" Hugo's rifle through a box of cables paused, \"No direct confrontation, sir, but I was an unfortunate audience to threats he made to my brother over a phone call. Nastiest conversation ever.\"\r\n\r\nWinston nodded, taking in the distraught sound engineer before himself. Hugo's brother owed a significant amount to Philip, everyone and their nephew knew that. It had been no blind gamble, but rather a bet gone awry. It had complicated Hugo's personal dynamics, certainly. Especially so since no one saw Hugo at the annual company holiday party. Usually a regular, Hugo's absence sent alerts.\r\n\r\nDuty kept Hugo traveling between different venues for sound gigs, with a vast array of tools tagging all along, wires included, also, wires very similar to the ones found at Philip's crime scene. Winston mulled over this kaleidoscope of details, knowing well the devil lay in their details, as he drove back to the precinct.",

In his hands, he held a stack of emails, one of which indicated that Paige had set up a meeting with Iris on the day of her death. He had also discovered a certificate amongst Paige's belongings that showed she had completed a self-defense course complete with stun gun training. He also noticed that as Iris's direct subordinate, Paige was next in line to lead the company, particularly since Iris didn't have any family members who could inherit the role. Additionally, he held company accounts that show a gradual decline in profits, a likely result of Iris's stubbornness to cut staff numbers and her constant investment in unsuccessful projects.\r\n\r\nAn email, a key to Iris's car found among Paige's belongings confirming her access, a timestamp, and a set of scorched fingerprints were all he had. Adding to this, CCTV footage from the company consistently showed Iris's car parked at their workplace confirming her regular presence. Straightening up in his chair, he got up, stretched, and went to interview his next suspect on the list - Paige, who had recently been seen on CCTV footage purchasing a stun gun.\r\n\r\nMaking his way out of the police station, Winston found himself in a tall glass building, home to the company that Iris had managed.

Welcome,\" said Paige.\r\n\r\nWinston glanced at the trash next to her desk, spotting a receipt from the stun gun shop that coincided with the CCTV footage and asked, \"Have you been keeping up with your stun gun training?\"\r\n\r\nPaige looked taken aback, but answered, \"Yes, I find it essential. Safety matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective nodded, an unease creeping up on him as he thought about the circumstances surrounding Iris's death, wondering whether the profits would rise once again now that Paige was stepping up.\r\n\r\nWinston took a sip of his cold coffee as he lay his eyes on the glossy wedding album of Iris. Alicia, who used they/them pronouns, must have done a flawless job for a wedding in this grandeur's scale.\r\n\r\nHe turned off the city streets, pulling into a small car park next to a utility store. Alicia was there, in the shop that sold stun guns among other things, surrounded by the cluttered mess of wires and bolts. Tagged along in their workspace was their office, filled with numerous taxidermy pufferfish that were unusually large and placed strategically for utmost visibility. As the owner and wedding planner, Alicia had to keep track of everything. Winston took a mental note of their electrical engineering degree framed on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Alicia,\" Winston intoned as they finally looked up from their workbench.\r\n\r\n\"Detective,\" They greeted him coolly, \"Here to pick a stun gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, I'm looking into a case,\" Winston said, sliding the crime scene photos across the counter.\r\n\r\nAlicia's eyes scanned them but they said nothing. Their hand didn't shake even when he laid out the receipt his team had found in their apartment. A receipt for a stun gun purchased a week ago.\r\n\r\n\"So, tell me about this,\" Winston motioned towards the pufferfish on their desk. Alicia’s eyes lit up as they started passionately rambling about the intricacies of it.\r\n\r\nWinston picked up their laptop, left casually open on police databases. The business' financials weren't good - they were operating at a loss and had to borrow heavily from nontraditional lenders. This major wedding event must have been a boost for them, financially speaking.\r\n\r\nWinston got up, preparing to leave. \"Your work here, it's all very remarkable, Alicia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your words, detective,\" they said, their gaze shifting once again to the photographs laid out on the bench.\r\n\r\nWinston had no choice but to leave them to their pufferfish and stun guns. \"Take care, Alicia,\" he said before walking out the door.",

        "context": "In the chilling aftermath of Iris' untimely death by a stun gun in a lonely parked car, seasoned detective Winston finds himself waist-deep in a web of intrigue involving two prime suspects, Paige and Alicia.\r\n\r\nPulling off his reading glasses, Detective Winston stared in thought at the computer screen. The emails between Iris and Paige showed a scheduled meeting for the day of the murder. He looked over to Iris's company accounts and noticed a fall in profits that had been happening over some time.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anyone from Iris's family that could take over the company?\" he asked his  young assistant who was pouring over police reports in the corner.\r\n\r\n\"No, she didn't have any family,\" the assistant called back.\r\n\r\nAs Winston dug deeper into the case, he found that Paige, as Iris's direct subordinate, would be the next in line for company leadership. Questioning them could give him some more perspective.\r\n\r\nHe found them sitting in their office, fiddling with a set of keys. He couldn't help but notice they were surrounded by a collection of pens from various meets, a quirk that was both peculiar and endearing. However, his keen eye was caught by a hair tie that was nestled amongst the pens.\r\n\r\n\"You pick that up recently?\" He chimed, nodding towards the hair tie. Caught off guard, Paige nodded, \"Yes, it was on the floor in the office.\" Winston just nodded, filing that information away for later.\r\n\r\nDiving into their conversation, Paige admitted that Iris was a dedicated boss, refusing to cut staff numbers and that she kept investing in unsuccessful projects, much to the chagrin of others. Paige admitted to knowing about the company's deteriorating health, given Iris's stubborn management methods, yet, they seemed thoroughly sad about their boss's demise.\r\n\r\nJust then, one of Paige's employees entered, looking flustered. \"I found something weird,\" they said, showing Winston something that looked like a keyhole behind a movable panel in Paige’s desk... a stark contrast to the otherwise meticulous space around them. His curiosity piqued, Winston thanked them and left with a promise for further communication.\r\n\r\nWalking around the company's parking lot, he noticed Iris's car often in the frame of the CCTV footage. A coworker who was pulling out of the lot told Winston about seeing Iris the night she died.\r\n\r\n\"Saw her going into that meeting with Paige; they looked real tense, \" the coworker indicated a glass cabin that evidently served as the meeting room.\r\n\r\nWinston decided to question Paige further. \"Do you have a key to Iris's car by any chance?\" A flicker of surprise flashed across Paige's face as they answered, \"Yes, I do. Is something wrong, Detective?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, just following up on some leads. Thank you for your time,\" he assured them before making his way back to his car.\r\n\r\nWinston flicked through the paperwork once more, using the dull humming coming from the precinct to focus his thoughts. In front of him, there was a landscape photo featuring Alicia in action, surrounded by a sea of flower crowns and women in long dresses. She was a wedding planner, overseeing all the details, including the transportation.\r\n\r\nHe looked deeper into the photo and noticed an electronic store across the street, where a store associate had reported Alicia making a purchase. Winston remembered speaking to that associate, who confirmed Alicia bought a stun gun there. This was a store that also sold stun guns, which had recently been purchased by Alicia. It confirmed what he was told, she did work in such a shop part-time.\r\n\r\nWinston glanced out his window, thinking pensive thoughts. The wedding required Iris’s car. It was Alicia’s job to ensure the car was used appropriately during the grand event. It certainly was a grand event, and it was a big payday for Alicia’s business.\r\n\r\n“Detective Winston, we have new documents for you.” An officer placed a file on his desk with a 'thump'. Financial statements. Alicia’s business wasn’t doing well. In fact, it was operating at a loss.\r\n\r\nHeaving a sigh, Winston packed the files into his case. He made his way to Alicia’s apartment. As he walked through the entrance, his gaze fell upon a ledge where the mail was neatly stacked. He could see a receipt peeping out. With a pair of thin gloves, he picked it up. A receipt from the shop. The same shop where Alicia was seen buying a stun gun.\r\n\r\nHe knew Alicia had studied electrical engineering during her college years. She would definitely know how to use it. His mobile device buzzed then, alerting him to a new email. It contained background info on Alicia's financials. A different kind of record... Alicia had been borrowing heavily, and mostly not from banks. Nontraditional lenders... not an ideal situation to be in.\r\n\r\nStepping outside, Winston lit a cigarette, his hand steady, but mind racing. But then, his phone buzzed again with a new update from precinct. There were multiple eyewitnesses who reported seeing Alicia and Iris together just before the incident. The last time they'd been seen together, was leaving the wedding rehearsal. The same evening when the incident happened.\r\n\r\n“Just the facts, Winston. Just the facts,” he said to himself, squashing out the cigarette and returning inside. There was more to uncover, and Alicia just happened to be at the center of it. Time would reveal the truth.",

        "context": "In the heart of bustling Times Square, Johnny's life was abruptly ended with an unlikely weapon—a trident—and now, Detective Winston must unravel the murky truths hidden behind suspects Jay and Karl, a non‑binary soul,.\n \n\n Winston peered at the case file and twitched his cigarette. Another one bit the dust in Times Square, a pretty common sight as of late. Jay, the regular local of the square, had made another one of his notorious catches, or so he seemed to be trying to. This time, however, it wasn't in the joy of celebration. \n \n\n Arresting the immediate crime scene routine, it came to an adoptive father. Jay, a man who loved his adopted son, Johnny, as deeply as his own blood. Unmistakably, he treated him with undying affection. Jay was a local fisherman, known to bait his lines and toss his nets in Times Square us with unusual regularity.\n \n\n Winston was no stranger to the peculiar. A man making his catch amidst the solemn sea of humanity seemed alien yet plausible in ways nothing else could be. Winston lit another cigarette, his eyes tracing the hotel reservation confirmation in Jay’s name at a nearby hotel; Jay was also at Times Square for New Year's celebrations.\n \n\n Now, that wasn’t unusual. After all, many locals booked rooms not far to be around the electric New Year’s celebration. Johnny, too, was part of the cacophony that night, showering in the confetti rain and the bursts of fireworks.\n \n\n A cold shiver ran down Winston's spine as he recalled a conversation he had picked up where Jay overheard Johnny's intention to expose his illegal fishery.\n \n\n The dynamics between a father and son duo is a complex bond. Johnny had officially registered himself under Jay’s guardianship quite a while ago, and now his disclosure had ignited an unexpected storm. \n \n\n Winston dropped his gaze onto the pictures of Jay's house. A noticeable collection caught his eyes. A vast array of tridents, carefully displayed and proudly shown off to any guest entering his abode. With an uneasiness settling over him, Winston noted that one of the tridents was strikingly similar to the weapon linked to Johnny's murder.\n \n\n Winston took the last puff of his cigarette, and he ground the stub into the ashtray, turning over all the facts in his head. Already, the investigation looked murky, muddled with familial ties and sinister events.\n \n\n Despite the rising sun casting long shadows, the path before Winston remained dark.\n \n\n It was time to interview Jay, Winston decided, as he pieced together the intricate pattern connecting paternity, fishing, and a bloody murder.\n \n\n Winston viewed the stark crime scene photos of Johnny's brutal murder in Times Square. The murder weapon was a trident, an oddity in any case, which only added to the eerie nature of Times Square, a place that seemed to attract all sorts of outlandish incidents.\n \n\n His only solid lead so far was stock broker Karl, whom Johnny had been suspicious of. Karl was known to deal with more than just Wall Street, handling the financial investments of some of the most prominent celebrities. Well-known for his connections and unconventional tactics, it was rumored that he often used insider information for personal gain, a decidedly illegal maneuver on the stock market.\n \n\n During their final showdown, Johnny had threatened to go to the police with evidence that pointed to Karl's crooked stock manipulations. But Johnny was brutally murdered before he could even do so. Now, as he viewed the images of Johnny's murder, Winston felt a deepening sense of dread.\n \n\n It was time to question Karl. Upon arrival in the heart of Wall Street where Karl had his office, he found a bustling hub of blue suits. Amidst this flurry, Karl stood out, impeccably dressed and complete with a cordial smile he typically saved for his high-profile clients.\n \n\n \"Greetings, Detective,\" Karl said calmly.\n \n\n \"Good afternoon, Karl,\" Winston replied, keeping his tone neutral. \"Can we have a moment to speak in private?\"\n \n\n In Karl's luxurious private office, an array of historical weapons adorned the walls, an unusual decorative taste for a corporate figure. Winston began the conversation stating the facts he already knew, \"So you're a fan of historical weapons?\"\n \n\n \"Not just a fan,\" Karl replied, putting on a proud smile, \"Last summer, I even took lessons in trident fighting. It's all part of my personal life that I’d rather keep to myself. I’m not too fond of sharing personal information.\"\n \n\n Upon digging deeper into Karl's dealings, Karl became visibly uncomfortable. His stiff body language indicated that he wasn't too keen on discussing his personal life further. Winston, however, continued to press on, bringing up Johnny and the documents he had left behind before his death - evidence of Karl's illegal stock manipulation.\n \n\n Karl retained an impressively unflappable demeanor, revealing no hints of guilt or remorse. However, the mention of Johnny and the documents seemed to create a ripple in his stoic shell.\n \n\n Then a call came to Winston's phone; it was his assistant informing him of the result of the search at Karl's house. Among the collection of historical artifacts and weapons, a trident was found - a chilling answer to the choice of murder weapon.\n \n\n Confronting Karl with this latest discovery, Winston noticed a visible strain on Karl's face, his corporate mask slipping momentarily. After bidding him goodbye, Winston left the office, leaving a now silent Karl amongst his historical weapons and luxurious comforts. His passion for historical warfare had now become the primary focus of the murder investigation.",

The lights always seemed brighter after such a grim event. This used to be where Johnny, a legally adopted son of Jay, and Jay himself celebrated New Year's. However, tonight, their anticipated joint celebration was tarnished with tragedy. Jay was meant to accompany his son tonight, as he always did in previous years. Yet, today, the gaiety was marred by the spilt blood of young Johnny.\n \n\n Taking silent inventory of the night's events, Winston departed Times Square and headed towards the residence of his unsuspecting suspect, Jay. He received curious glances from the neighbors as he passed by. His presence was quite striking given they were accustomed to seeing the irregular delivery trucks from far-flung places, implying Jay's suspected illegal fishery.\n \n\n Reaching Jay's estate, Winston was greeted with a spectacle bizarre yet beautiful. Carefully arranged insects, like war trophies, were displayed for all. The place breathed less like an extermination spot and more like an entomologists’ gallery. In their conversation, Jay fervently talked of insects' idiosyncrasies reminiscing often about his entomology degree he pursued in college. It was a knowledge accumulated over the years, he claimed.\n \n\n Despite such peculiar oddities, something else caught Winston’s attention. Jay's demeanor exhibited an aura of a grieving father who had just lost his child. Every word, every gesture towards Johnny was drenched in fatherly affection. This he observed as he subtly probed into Jay's Times Square hotel booking from that very night shared over their New Year's plans discussion.\n \n\n Jay confidently produced the confirmation for his hotel reservation, confirming his presence at Times Square, booked for the very night of the murder taking place. He seemed unbothered, almost casual like discussing an ordinary routine, even when Johnny's intention to report his illegal fishery was disclosed. Winston found this revelation stirring. Johnny had confessed to him, and unbelievably, Jay happened to overhear their private conversation revealing Johnny's turn of trust.\n \n\n The conversation took a turn towards Jay's unusual hobbies, including the exotic delivery trucks that catered to his needs, and the display cases filled with nicely arranged insects. Jay, light-hearted in his response, flirted with anecdotes trailing from his college days.\n \n\n The air was thick with grief as they remembered Johnny. Loaded with information, Winston pieced together a clear perspective of the suspect. Yet the investigation was far from over. Something hung unanswered, unfinished. As Winston exited Jay's house, silence echoed the unspoken truths left to be discovered.\n \n\n Winston scrutinized the surroundings of Times Square. It was almost surreal that amidst the clamor and hustle, a murder had taken place here, Johnny's murder. The murder weapon was peculiar, a trident.\n \n\n Despite the city's innumerable faces, battalions of CCTV cameras, incessantly flashing screens surrounding the quadrant, a witness had spotted Karl here.\n \n\n Clearing his throat, Winston began his interrogation. \"You've been spotted here today Karl, can you explain that?\"\n \n\n The reply came quick, \"Yeah, I was here, detective. I come here often.\"\n \n\n \"You and Johnny had an argument?\"\n \n\n \"Yes,\" Karl nodded, then his face grew grave. \"He threatened to go to the police about some documents he'd found. I tried to reason with him,” said Karl, his voice trembling slightly. “But we argued. We argued often. He had a hot temper, and I suspect, mad as hell he was.\"\n \n\n People swarmed around like an ongoing carnival, but Winston kept his gaze unwavered on Karl. \"You have a soft spot for history, don't you?\" Winston ventured.\n \n\n \"Yeah, I love historical weaponry. I've got a nice collection at home,\" Karl stated somewhat proudly.\n \n\n Winston knew, his suspicion was correct. The house search had revealed a Trident among Karl's collection of ancient weapons, now confiscated.\n \n\n \"Interesting,\" he observed. \"Used any of them? For fighting or such.\"\n \n\n \"Tridents... I took some trident fighting lessons last summer,\" Karl admitted with an awkward laugh.\n \n\n Strange coincidence, or just an indication of motives, Winston thought. Besides, the trident and Times Square; there was also that heated argument over some documents about his financial misdemeanors.\n \n\n \"Financial misdemeanors,\" Winston probed.\n \n\n The look in Karl's eyes revealed something, but he simply shrugged, \"Stock market’s a tricky business, detective. Johnny didn't fully understand it.\"\n \n\n Winston thanked him for his time and left. City lights illuminated the square. Karl, now successful in stock manipulation, hoped to remain unseen by the police. But Johnny knew, and had discovered evidence of Karl’s illegal activities. Winston had a feeling, the city that never slept would soon reveal its hidden truths.",

        "context": "In the tranquil world of pirouettes and pliés, prima ballerina Giselle is found dead with a syringe at a dance studio and it’s up to the steely-eyed Detective Winston to interrogate two unlikely suspects - Fred and Imogen, a proudly non‑binary person,.\n \n\n Winston stared at the dance floor of the studio, reflecting on the horrific incident. Giselle, who had been practicing late in the night, was found in this one spot, a syringe sticking out. The studio was eerily quiet.\n \n\n The security guard for the night, Fred, was now on the detective's radar. Guarding the studio, running its lost and found, working around the property, Fred had a significant hold on the location. Among his responsibilities was to ensure the items on the premises were secure. Recently, a syringe was reported misplaced and entered into the lost and found - the very syringe that, as per the Coroner's report, had been used in Giselle's murder.\n \n\n Fred seemed more nervous than an employee should be given the circumstances. Scheduled to check properties during the time Giselle was practicing, he would have had the opportunity to interact with her. \n \n\n \"Giselle...she was a hell of a dancer,\" Fred said, stepping away to look the dance floor. \"Here late most nights, always the last to leave.\"\n \n\n He hesitated before continuing, \"She...she threatened to go to the authorities, about...about some things.\"\n \n\n Fred's discomfort with the subject was evident. Giselle had found out about a few security lapses in the studio, and Fred was aware she had the evidence. She had threatened to report him, to show up his glaring disregard for the job he was responsible for.\n \n\n Reflecting on the evidence, Winston looked at Fred. He was a night guard, in charge of property management. He had access to the studio, the found syringe, knowledge of Giselle's plans. He was more connected to the case than he probably would have liked.\n \n\n Glancing back at the dance floor, Fred stared long and hard at the place where Giselle's body had been found. \"I hear her sometimes, you know. The tap of her dance shoes. It's like she's still here.\"\n \n\n Winston gave him a nod, made his notes before stepping out of the dance studio, leaving Fred alone with the haunting echo of Giselle's dance.\n \n\n Winston shuffled the crime scene photos into a neat stack and replaced them in their folder. The image of the dance studio – clear aside from the single syringe lying in the centre – was fresh in his mind. He traced the edges of the file with a thoughtful brow and stood, straightening his jacket. The victim's godmother was waiting for him at her current workplace - the local hospital where she works as a nurse in her effort to pay off her debts, despite having lost her nursing job at a different hospital recently.\n \n\n Imogen's life hadn't exactly gone according to plan. She used to be a respected nurse at another hospital, with a stable income, but now, despite her job at a new hospital, she was still struggling with severe debt, worsened by medical expenses she could hardly afford. One day, someone noticed Imogen with a set of keys that had been laying around the hospital. They were of a decidedly peculiar design, matching those from her former hospital. According to some people’s reports, they were similar to the ones used in prisons.\n \n\n His first meeting was with Imogen herself. She was a middle-aged woman with worry lines that were etched deep into her face, a contrast from her professional demeanor at the hospital. Despite her situation, her eyes held a fierce spark of determination and resilience.\n \n\n \"Giselle was saving up for her future, you know,\" Imogen began, after the pleasantries were over. \"She was a tenacious dancer, no children to her name, but wealthy nonetheless.\"\n \n\n Winston asked about her relationship with Giselle, about her financial circumstances. Imogen was upfront about her financial issues, about how she had asked Giselle for help, despite being her godmother. She didn’t hide the fact that she had recently lost her job at the other hospital. \n \n\n Imogen shared a story about an escape plan she cooked up once. It was detailed and quite intricate, considering it was made up on the spot during a party. It was said in jest over drinks, but the detail of the plan was plausible to say the least.\n \n\n Winston left the woman with a curt nod, wondering if Imogen’s elaborate plan was simply the ramblings of a desperate woman or perhaps, more than that. Her life, after all, had not worked out the way anyone would have hoped. And life, he knew, had a tendency of pushing people to do things they never thought they could.",

        "context": "In the tranquil world of pirouettes and pliés, prima ballerina Giselle is found dead with a syringe at a dance studio and it’s up to the steely-eyed Detective Winston to interrogate two unlikely suspects - Fred, who identifies as non‑binary, and Imogen.\n \n\n It was a typically bleak morning as detective Winston reflected on the upcoming staff meeting. No doubt Fred, the diligent night shift security guard for Dance Studio Giselle had devoted her life to, would again bring up the unsolved murder case. It was a habit of Fred to discuss the crime, be it casually or at a formal setting like the staff meetings.\n \n\n Winston remembered Giselle mentioning Fred's constant references to the crime whenever they had personal interactions. Giselle's murder, occurring during a late-night practice at her dance studio when Fred was on his night shift, had flipped their world upside down, and now there was a whole list of strange occurrences. Fred had been caught, multiple times, brooding over his notebook scribbling details about the various events. Not just during his nightly shifts, but meticulously recording the date, time, and details of each recent crime that took place in and around the dance studio.\n \n\n Winston often wondered about the contents of Fred's notebook. He recalled Fred having overheard a personal conversation between Giselle and himself when she had openly voiced her plans to bring her findings about his security lapses to the authorities. It was strange how quickly Fred had been informed about it, almost as if he had intentionally been listening in.\n \n\n Slowly sipping his coffee, Winston made his way to Fred’s space, hearing the familiar scratch of Fred’s pen against paper. Fred, tall with broad shoulders and a hard-set face, looked up, his pen momentarily idle.\n \n\n Fred, never one to skip over details, asked, as if on cue, \"Detective, any updates about the murder?\"\n \n\n \"Fred,\" Winston carefully started, acknowledging his inquiry. \"Yes, updates about Giselle's claim of finding evidence against your nighttime security practices and her plan of taking it to the authorities. You knew about it, didn't you?\"\n \n\n Fred chuckled nervously and looked down at his notebook, his eyes lingering on his detailed crime records. Nodding, he softly confessed, \"Yes, I overheard her talking about it. Couldn't help but worry, detective.\"\n \n\n Intent on keeping a keen eye on each detail, detective Winston left Fred back to recounting the happenings in his notebook, knowing there were a lot more facts to align in this perplexing puzzle.\n \n\n Winston assembled his notes and drained his mug of lukewarm coffee. He turned his thoughts to Giselle, the victim. From all accounts she was a wealthy ballerina, well-loved in the community, rarely seen without a crowd applauding her every move. She had no children, but was known to be frugal, having long been building a nest egg for an ambitious future. He grimaced. The future was one thing she no longer had.\n \n\n His next stop was at a bustling hospital. His entrance was marked by the characteristic smell of disinfectant and the chaos of emergency medical staff rushing about. Among them, he used to find Imogen, a former nurse who likely felt comfortable amidst the syringes, gloves and pill bottles. Imogen had worked there long enough to cultivate a reliable reputation, until her recent dismissal. Winston had been notified about her job loss by a hospital insider.\n \n\n After the hospital, detective Winston drove to Imogen's house. Imogen was Giselle’s godmother, and they shared a close bond, so close that Giselle confided in her like no other. Imogen was among the few who knew about Giselle’s financial prudence as she saved for the future. Giselle treated Imogen like a member of her own family, even extending an implicit trust to her. She invited Imogen to her performances and elite parties frequently, detective Winston noted a stack of fancy invitations on Imogen's side table. \n \n\n With the pleasantries out of the way, the detective carefully broached the subject of Imogen’s financial struggles. He had discovered that Imogen had some rather sizable medical bills to pay. These bills burdened her with a severe debt. This was no small sum to be owing, especially after losing her job.\n \n\n “You asked for financial help from Giselle, didn't you?” he asked, choosing his words carefully. Imogen looked away, nodding and admitting,\"Yes, losing my job was a shock. I asked her for help.\"\n \n\n Winston could tell this wasn’t an easy admission for Imogen, her goddaughter’s death compounded by the guilt of asking for financial help. As their conversation came to an end, Winston thanked her for cooperation and walked back to his car. \n \n\n No conclusions had been drawn. No suspects had been named, but the information gathered from Imogen was another piece in a complex puzzle. The very picture of a detective's work. A bottomless mug of coffee, a relentless quest for answers... and a lingering smell of hospital disinfectant.",

        "model_output": " To determine the most likely murderer, we need to evaluate each suspect based on the criteria of means, motive, and opportunity.\n\n1. Fred:\n   - Means: Fred had access to the dance studio during his night shift, and it's possible that he could have obtained a syringe from the first aid kit or elsewhere in the studio.\n   - Motive: Fred overheard Giselle planning to report his security lapses to the authorities, which could have been a motive for him to want to silence her. However, this motive is not definitive as it's not clear if Fred would resort to murder over this issue.\n   - Opportunity: Fred was on duty during the night of the murder, giving him access to the crime scene.\n\n2. Imogen:\n   - Means: Imogen was a former nurse and had experience handling syringes, but it's not clear if she had access to one at the dance studio or elsewhere.\n   - Motive: Imogen was in financial trouble and had asked Giselle for help, which could have been a motive for her to kill Giselle if she felt that Giselle was not going to provide the help or was delaying it.\n   - Opportunity: Imogen was close to Giselle and had access to her, but it's not clear if she had the opportunity to be at the dance studio during the night of the murder.\n\nComparing the two suspects, Fred seems to have a stronger case for the murder. He had means (access to the dance studio and possibly a syringe), motive (Giselle was planning to report him), and opportunity (he was on duty during the night of the murder). Imogen, on the other hand, has a possible motive (financial troubles and Giselle's refusal to help), but her means and opportunity are less clear.\n\nANSWER: 1 - Fred. Fred appears to have the strongest case for the murder based on the established criteria of means, motive, and opportunity. However, it's important to note that this is a fictional scenario and the actual solution could be different based on additional information or evidence that has not been presented.",

        "context": "Inside the buzzing hubbub of the city's most popular recording studio, Ivan's death by snake venom sends shockwaves through the music realm, forcing the indomitable Detective Winston to pierce the veil of sound and silence, suspects, Timothy and Ricky, a non‑binary soul,, echoing in his ears.\n \n\n The buzzing audio equipment of the recording studio filled the eerie silence as Winston took in the place where Ivan's life had tragically ended. The coroner's report indicated Ivan's time of death aligns perfectly with when Timothy, a self-professed herpetology enthusiast with extensive knowledge of acquiring and handling venom from his exotic snakes, had been at the studio. It had only been a few days, but the studio felt hauntingly empty. He turned his gaze to the padded wall, where someone had written, \"Timothy and Ivan, a deadly harmony.\"\n \n\n It was here that Winston found a recorded conversation between Ivan and Timothy, where Ivan fiercely confronted Timothy about his secret affair with Ivan's girlfriend. \"You'll have hell to pay,\" Ivan had threatened in the recording. Clearly, Ivan was no longer a mere obstacle for Timothy, but a threat to his secret relationship that he wouldn't afford to get exposed.\n \n\n Back at headquarters, Winston found himself faced with Timothy in the interrogation room, a lanky lad with a laid-back demeanor of a surfing instructor. \"So, Timothy,\" began Winston trying to cut through the tension. \"You were at the recording studio on the day Ivan died, right?\"\n \n\n \"Yeah...\" Timothy played with the frayed edge of his board shorts, \"We were working on a music project, you know. I just... I had no idea he was gonna end up... like that.\"\n \n\n \"And no one else was at the studio then, I assume?\" Winston questioned calmly. Timothy merely nodded, his gaze fixed on the plain metal table between them.\n \n\n Winston pursued, \"I heard... something about Ivan confronting you about your secret affair with his girlfriend. That'd make anyone pretty jealous. And then you'd be afraid Ivan would reveal your secret, right?\" Silence followed as Timothy clenched his jaw tightly, hands nervously tightening into fists. His jealousy was evident, as was his fear of Ivan revealing their secret relationship.\n \n\n Later that day, Winston found himself wandering down to a strange, exotic animal shop in the city. The shopkeeper, a wiry man with spectacles, recognized Timothy from a photograph. Timothy frequented the place, purchasing his exotic snakes from here - not just for their beauty but also for the lethal venom some of them could produce.\n \n\n \"They're beautiful creatures,\" the shopkeeper remarked, \"Can be really dangerous though. Timothy knows that. He spends hours studying them and knows exactly how to handle them and their venom.\"\n \n\n Winston nodded, thoughts racing in his mind. The timeline was starting to line up... Ivan confronted Timothy about his affair with his girlfriend, resulting in Timothy becoming jealous. With his advanced knowledge of venom and snakes, Timothy could have easily silenced Ivan forever. As he walked out of the store, Winston looked back at the snakes. Their eyes gleamed ominously under the warm lights, a dangerous secret they shared with their owner.\n \n\n Detective Winston stared at the envelope in his hands. It contained a recording of a man's voice... Ricky's voice. Ricky had confessed to engaging in illegal activities at the pet shop he owned during a one-on-one meeting with Ivan, an incriminating evidence towards Ricky. Ivan, Ricky's employee, had managed to record this meeting and now was using it to blackmail his boss. Ivan was the sole possessor of such damning evidence against Ricky. The envelope addressed to Ivan had been found amongst the many other envelopes from anonymous senders that overloaded Ricky's mail box daily. Winston sighed, mentally checking off the initial facts.\n \n\n Stepping inside the pet shop, Winston noted Ricky, the man who was visibly apprehensive. He was holding onto something, something that spelled danger. Ricky owned a venomous snake- his trusted companion. Winston's eyes narrowed visibly, remembering Ricky's well-versed knowledge of venom extraction. But right now, his attention was more focused on the legal documents that lay strewn about the table. The pet shop was in his name, and the blackmail was threatening ruin, both financially and legally.\n \n\n Suddenly, Ricky moved. He pulled open a drawer bursting with wigs, glasses, and an assortment of props. Instantly, Winston recalled the photograph he received from a witness, who had spotted Ricky at a passport photo shop. The picture showed Ricky surrounded by various props, similar to the ones he now held in his hands. Ricky seemed to be prepared for every eventuality, but why? Winston kept his thoughts to himself, focusing on the task at hand.\n \n\n Ricky moved around the room, apparently agitated. Winston asked him mundane questions, like how his day had been, what his work involved. Ricky, nervous though he was, responded readily. Soon, minutes turned into hours as the detective–suspect duo sat locked in an interrogation that was as much unspoken as spoken. The room still held the echo of Ivan's lethal poisoning, and with each word uttered, Ricky painted a complex canvas; a canvas depicting a secretive life of illegal activities, desperate actions, and an existence losing coherence amidst the deceit.\n \n\n Winston knew, the mystery was far from solved. There were still layers to Ricky that needed to be peeled back. He knew he had a tough task ahead with numerous clues left to be discovered. As he exited the pet shop door, he bade farewell to a day filled with questioning and welcomed an impending journey of uncloaking the truth.",

Detective Winston stared at the dispatch report and heaved a weary sigh. Highlighted information spelled out a sad tale of love, jealousy, and secrets; especially the ones contained in Timothy's silent confession of an argument where Ivan confronted him about the affair with his girlfriend.\n \n\n As he entered the studio, a peculiar detail stood out – it was empty when the victim was found. The police had taken the usual preliminary measures, clearing the premises as they went. That detail played a repetitive note in Winston's mind. There was only one name that matched the time of death, Timothy.\n \n\n Begrudgingly, he agreed to interview Timothy, the victim’s friend and also a surfing instructor by trade. Timothy's van was a shrine to waxed boards of all sizes, shapes, and colors, almost like weapons of battle against the waves. When Winston had asked him about it, Timothy fondly explained that every board had its unique purpose, for each wave and beach condition. His job demanded him to know places, waves, and beaches in intimate detail. One could even notice the envy tinged bitterness in Timothy's voice when he shared his love for discovering new surfing spots and how Ivan’s musical success overshadowed his own aspirations.\n \n\n “What brings you here, detective?” Timothy's voice cut through Winston's thoughts. “Well, you were last seen here with Ivan. You guys…\"\n \n\n “Yeah, we were working on a music project together,” Timothy finished Winston's half-spoken question. His face turned a shade darker as he added, “That was our thing, you know. He did the music, I brought the vibe. But everyone always loved Ivan more, even my own girlfriend.”\n \n\n There was a certain restlessness in Timothy's manner. His eyes kept darting towards the door, his van in sight. It was always packed and ready; 'to chase the waves,' Timothy had shared during the friendly chit-chat. His resentment towards Ivan had resurfaced, amplified by the fact that Ivan's girlfriend was now in love with him.\n \n\n When Winston mentioned Ivan's girlfriend, Timothy's smile tightened. Yet when he asked about the argument where Ivan had confronted him about the affair, the smile faded away completely. He didn't want to expose sharper edges of their relationship; the complex, fraught friendship woven with threads of rivalry and jealousy. Most of all, there was a looming fear of Ivan revealing their secret affair to the world.\n \n\n Winston slowly stood up, giving Timothy a knowing look. He thanked him for his time and walked away, leaving an unsettling silence behind him as Timothy sat, staring at the spot where Ivan used to create music. His secret was a festering wound he had no idea how to treat, and the fear of exposure was a haunting melody he couldn't escape.\n \n\n At the end of a long day, Winston found himself standing on the bridge, gazing at the dark and unyielding ocean. The carefully collected facts played on repeat, like a song stuck in a loop. He couldn't help but think of Timothy, his passions, his secrets, his fear, his jealousy, and his time at the studio which eerily aligned with the irrevocable end of Ivan's life. A hazy picture began to take form in his mind, but he knew it was far from complete...There were still missing notes in this haunting symphony of death.\n \n\n Detective Winston stepped out of his car and straightened his tie as he made his way towards the pet shop. An older man stood at the entrance, a look of potential fear and regret on his face. \n \n\n \"Ricky?\" Winston asked with a raised eyebrow.\n \n\n \"Depends who's asking,\" Ricky responded, eyeing Winston over. \n \n\n \"Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself and showed his badge. He noticed a change in Ricky's demeanor. \"Might we have a word regarding your business?\"\n \n\n Ricky, swallowing hard, nodded and gestured to the back room of the pet shop. It was filled with a variety of animals, among them a large, intimidating venomous snake settled in a glass tank, aptly showcased as the shop's specialty.\n \n\n \"You seem to have quite a variety of pets here, and appropriate paperwork on display. You do legally own this place, don't you?\" Winston asked, pointing at the legal documents hanging on the wall.\n \n\n Ricky, still unsettled, nodded, \"Yes. I also know a bit about venom extraction, which makes this business unique,\" he added with an attempt at lightheartedness. \n \n\n \"You know, the police got a tip-off about some illegal activity regarding this pet shop,\" Winston continued. Ricky's eyes widened.\n \n\n \"Why, I've no idea what you're insinuating detective,\" Ricky stuttered, looking like a man who feared impending financial and legal repercussions.\n \n\n \"Your financial situation hasn't been the best we've heard,\" Winston said, \"and someone named Ivan has been feeding us some rather interesting information regarding your debts.\"\n \n\n \"Ivan.\" Ricky whispered under his breath.\n \n\n \"It seems you had a private meeting with Ivan in an empty recording studio,\" Winston revealed, seeing Ricky's surprise at this information. \"That's where he recorded your conversation, and you confessed to some illegal activities, didn't you?\"\n \n\n Ricky looked down and then glanced up, resignation in his eyes. He nodded somberly, \"Yes, Ivan was the only one who knew about the illegal activities... He recorded me talking about the illegal sales and has been blackmailing me with the recording.\"\n \n\n Winston thanked Ricky for his time and walked out of the pet shop with much to ponder about this case. One thing was certain - the recording studio where Ricky made his confession was going to be his next stop.",

Jamal's empty chair, a token of a dangerous gamble. Too high of a stake, with a godchild as your appointed dealer.\n \n\n \"Lillian, was it?\" Winston began, attempting to keep his tone as neutral as possible. The woman before him, a young biologist specializing in amphibians, nodded as she squirmed slightly under his gaze.\n \n\n \"Jamal spoke highly of you,\" he said, casting an eye towards her drink. She gulped, but stayed silent.\n \n\n \"He trusted you,\" Winston continued, surveying the crime scene with his trained eye. \"Even was seen taking a sip from your very drink there.\"\n \n\n Lillian straightened in her chair. \"Always giving him advice,\" Winston mused, a thought dancing at the edge of his vision. \"And always willing to try something new.\"\n \n\n It wasn't hard to guess that Lillian had always desired more. The lust for power hung around her like an exotic perfume, intoxicating to those in her proximity. She wanted to be Jamal. Jamal, the casino mogul; his elusive empire tantalizingly within reach.\n \n\n Outside, the neon lights of the casino blinked erratically, casting an eerie greenish hue over the scene. A darting shadow caught Winston's attention - a strange silhouette of a rare species of frog in a glass tank, well-known amongst biologists for its lethal toxins, shimmered in the glow. An interesting pet for a woman so consumed with desire.\n \n\n \"Lillian, you're a herpetologist, we gather?\" Winston questioned, inclining his head towards the amphibian. She nodded, a glint appearing in her eyes. \"And you've been studying the toxins of this frog for years...\"\n \n\n Dismissing Lillian, Winston surveyed the casino once more. It was a den of decadence, a palace of transient prosperity run by Jamal, the giver of fortunes, who had no other known kin but a science-smitten child drawn to the perilous allure of her amphibian pets.\n \n\n One clear fact remained. Jamal had listened to Lillian and she... well, she was next in line for his throne. This was not a conjecture but a simple fact an observer might note, just as one might notice the inescapable presence of a rare poison frog in Lillian's possession.\n \n\n As Winston made his exit from the pulsating hub of the casino, his mind turned over the night's events. Lillian, pacing the casino floor, her eyes on Jamal, and Jamal's undying trust in his favored godchild. Pieces of a puzzle waiting to be fit together. But that, he left strictly for the reader to sort out.\n \n\n As Winston strolled through the garish neon lights of the casino, he watched the footage replay on the manager's phone. There they were, tucked into the high stake section; Kimberly, a picture-perfect shuffle of a grandma, and Jamal, joyfully throwing himself into the game with wild abandon.\n \n\n \"Yes,\" the manager confirmed for him. \"That’s Kimberly. Her card records place her at the same table as Jamal that night. She didn't leave until the medics arrived for him.\"\n \n\n \"Interesting,\" Winston replied, still not looking up from the phone.\n \n\n The detective continued his rounds, shuffling further into the labyrinth of the casino. Finally, he found the bar. He nodded at the barman, an inquisitive look in his eyes. \"Kimberly brought Jamal a drink that night, didn’t she?\"\n \n\n The barman swiped at an imaginary spill as he raised an eyebrow at Winston. \"Yeah, she did. One of those fancy drinks.\" His fingers drummed thoughtfully on the bartop, \"She had it delivered to the table he was playing at. He drank it right away too.\"\n \n\n Another loose thread to tuck away, perhaps. Winston next stop was Kimberly's house. Neighbors echoed praises about the grandmother, painting her as a caring woman who enjoys watching her grandchildren. Interestingly enough, each grandchild seemed to know her by a different name, and according to the school records, each had a distinct backstory of ‘grandma Kimberly’.\n \n\n Winston cradled a cup of coffee as he glanced through Kimberly's research papers. Geological, biological, a vast array of topics. But one caught his eye; a detailed study on various poisons, including how much was lethal. Of particular interest was one paper detailing the extraction methods for poison from a highly dangerous frog species.\n \n\n Flipping through her mail, each letter addressed to a unique mailing address, one for each city Kimberly had grandchildren. Winston noticed the faint hum of an odd contraption in her basement. Upon closer inspection, it was an ornate humidifier. Sitting inside a glass tank, a small frog, the same species she had written about.\n \n\n \"Got yourself a pet frog, Kimberly?\" Winston asked, blinking back a sense of unease.  \n \n\n \"Well, yes, I thought it'd be fascinating to own one,\" Kimberly answered, her voice steady yet pleasant. \"After buying it, I've done a lot of reading on it too.\"\n \n\n “I can tell,” Winston said, lightly tapping at the glass, his gaze looking upon the venomous creature inside, through the misty veil, before flicking over at Kimberly for a brief moment, \"I can tell.\"",

It was indeed an unusual evening, where he had gained knowledge that Jamal was about to reveal his secret gambling problem, a scandal that could have undoubtedly ruined the reputation of the Kurten family, before his tragic death ended those plans untimely.\n \n\n Winston found Kimberly, Jamal's grandmother, sitting sullenly with a spent slot machine, her eyes tired and glassy. She was always a lady of resolve, and her attire tonight attested her character. The familiar cigarette smoke-infused air around her gave gravity to the situation.\n \n\n \"We heard you've been interested in studying unique frog species,\" Winston started tentatively, referencing her recent purchase of a rare and highly poisonous frog, without failing to mention about the documents found in her home, which not only discussed extracting venom from the said species but also comprehensively detailed physical effects of the frog's lethal doses,\n \n\n \"Yes,\" Kimberly admitted. \"It's quite a fascinating hobby that I've picked up.\"\n \n\n \"Do you know the frog you own can be highly lethal?\" Winston probed, watching her reaction closely.\n \n\n \"Well, I am aware. In fact, I've read all about it, and that formed a substantial part of my research, especially investigating the effects of its venom,\" said Kimberly, revealing her ongoing project for the first time.\n \n\n Nodding, Winston changed the subject. \"You were with Jamal here at the casino, the night he tragically died, correct?\"\n \n\n \"Yes,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the chorus of slot machines and croupier calls. \"We both came here together.\"\n \n\n \"On the surveillance footage, it appears you brought Jamal his favorite drink that night. Barely a few moments after he had it, he collapsed.\"\n \n\n \"Yes, that's correct, Detective Winston,\" Kimberly confirmed, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, \"He wasn't feeling well all evening. I've always been worried about his reckless gambling, and the impact it would have on our standing in society, not to mention the ruin it would have brought upon us if he had his way.\"\n \n\n After a few moments of silence, Winston rose to excuse himself, leaving Kimberly dwelling in the harsh neon lights, weighed down by a grandmother's sorrow. Despite the clamoring commotion around him, Winston found an eerie silence; a tragic tale of love, concern, and reputation had unraveled that night.\n \n\n Sitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder. His brow furrowed at the cause of death - a lethal frog poison. The corners of his mouth twitched with a hint of moroseness and intrigue, as he thought of the exotic demise of a man so influential and with no known heirs or successors - except his goddaughter Lillian.\n \n\n Winston decided to pay Lillian, the goddaughter of the deceased, a visit. He remembered the name Lillian, an up-and-coming biologist specializing in amphibians, and now the apparent successor to Jamal's influential position — a coincidence too striking to ignore.\n \n\n On arriving at Lillian's residence, he knocked and was greeted by Lillian's younger brother, who he had noticed earlier mentioned a strict 9 p.m. curfew enforced by their parents — a prospect seeming unusual considering Lillian's mature age.\n \n\n \"Detective Winston, how can I help you?\" Lillian's voice was calm. Winston, with practiced ease, began to ask the routine questions.\n \n\n \"I understand from your colleagues at the research facility that you have spent years studying the toxins of various rare frog species. That's remarkable.\"\n \n\n \"Yes, I believe amphibians are hugely underestimated in their biological significance,\" Lillian responded, an earnest enthusiasm glowing in her eyes.\n \n\n Her comment whisked Winston's thoughts back to the exotic murder weapon. \"Are there any of such poisonous species that you happen to own?\"\n \n\n A slight hitch in Lillian's demeanor suggested hesitation. \"Yes, I do own a rare species of frog known to produce lethal toxins.\"\n \n\n Leaning back and taking note of her demeanor, Winston changed the topic slightly. \"Did you know about the late-night visits Jamal used to pay to the casino?\"\n \n\n \"No, but I knew of his influence and power in the community,\" Lillian replied, her eyes distant as she pondered over memories of her late godfather. She further added, \"Jamal didn't have any other known successors and being his goddaughter, I've always desired to be as respected and influential as he was, and to even take his position one day.\"\n \n\n As Winston prepared to leave, the local store owner from across the street approached him, offering a piece of information he hadn't considered.\n \n\n \"Saw Lillian over there popping out late for snacks,\" he mumbled; a detail that contradicted the household rule of strict curfew mentioned by Lillian's brother. It was backed up by another neighbor, who mentioned seeing Lillian sneaking out after dark on numerous occasions.\n \n\n It appeared there was more to this goddaughter, this aspiring biologist, than met the eye. This next in line to Jamal's influence and authority, known herpetologist, owner of a lethal frog species– was she just an innocent bystander? Winston intended to find out.",

This suggests she had the opportunity to visit the casino and potentially administer the poison.\n\n2. Kimberly:\n   - Motive: Kimberly was worried about Jamal's reckless gambling and the impact it would have on the Kurten family's reputation. If Jamal's gambling scandal was to be exposed, it could potentially harm the Kurten family's standing in society.\n   - Means: Kimberly recently purchased a rare and highly poisonous frog, and documents were found in her home detailing the extraction of venom from the said species and the physical effects of its lethal doses.\n   - Opportunity: While the surveillance footage shows Kimberly not leaving the casino until after the events of the tragic night had unraveled, it does not necessarily mean she did not have the opportunity to visit Jamal beforehand or to arrange for someone else to administer the poison.\n\nComparing the two suspects, Lillian seems to have a stronger case for motive, means, and opportunity. She had a motive to prevent Jamal's gambling scandal from being exposed, she owns the lethal frog species, and she was seen sneaking out after dark, which suggests she had the opportunity to visit the casino and potentially administer the poison.\n\nOn the other hand, while Kimberly also had a motive and means, her opportunity is less clear, as she was seen on surveillance footage only after the events of the tragic night had occurred.\n\nANSWER: 1 - Lillian.",

        "context": "In the bustling mayhem of the city mall, a man falls fatally to the seldom-seen weapon of a sai; it's up to the cunning and relentless Detective Winston to interrogate his only leads, Peyton and Isolde, a non‑binary soul,.\n \n\n Engrossed in his case files, Winston took a sip of his cold coffee. A quick brushing of the autopsy report led him to understand the brutal nature of Guy's death... by way of a Sai.\n \n\n Upon inquiring further into the murder weapon, he found out about a certain niece, Peyton, who was identified as a collector of such items. Weapons, all different kinds, were Peyton's obsession. Her fixation was so strong that it even crossed over to her recreational time, she took martial arts classes weekly. \n \n\n A thought popped into Winston's mind and he felt a sudden rush of adrenaline; Peyton was also proficient with the sai. The words of her martial arts instructor echoed in his mind, \"Peyton is proficient with the sai and many other weapons. She almost scared me with her skill.\"\n \n\n Winston moved on to Peyton's employment status. She worked daytime shifts. Interesting, he thought, as the mall murder had taken place at night. A leak about Peyton shopping frequently at the murder scene and her evident fondness for shopping only seemed to deepen the investigation.\n \n\n Recalling a statement of one of Guy's friends, he said, 'Guy told me he was planning to expose Peyton's secret'. Guy was about to spill Peyton's secret, and she had reacted to this threat fearfully, as if something precious was at stake. Winston remembered hearing the intense words Peyton had uttered \"I won't let you ruin me, Guy!\" Her secret was something she was desperate to keep hidden.\n \n\n He crumpled the empty coffee cup in his hand. Time to speak to Peyton.\n  \n As he drove off, he couldn't help but wonder. Just what was Peyton's secret? And what lengths did she go to, to keep it hidden? Winston knew he had to tread lightly, every piece of the puzzle mattered, even more so when everyone was a suspect.\n \n\n The constant clinking of glasses and din of jovial voices filled the air as Winston idled near the polished oak bar. His eyes were focused on the bartender - a stern-looking woman named Isolde. He had heard the rumors about her refusing service to customers from Guy's ethnic background, and those claims had piqued his interest. Guy himself had complained to his family about this, and the distaste in their voices as they spewed recounts of the tales was a clear indicator of the gravity of the situation. Isolde was not just known for her reputation as a martinet bartender but was also notable for her martial arts prowess, evident when she was seen practicing with sai at her martial arts school. Her frequent sai practice sessions at the school held his attention tonight.\n  \n Leaning on the edge of the bar, he made eye contact with her. Isolde's expression was guarded as she glanced at him once, appearing hesitant because of the past. Guy's coworkers, who frequented the very bar, had shared stories of hearing racial slurs she had thrown at Guy. They had also relayed these offensive exchanges to Guy's family, fueling the flame that Winston was now looking into. He recognized her from those recounts, the complaints about the woman named Isolde vivid in his memory.\n \n\n Meeting her gaze, he gestured to the collection of martial arts DVDs displayed at one corner of the bar. \"Into martial arts movies, I see.\"\n \n\n Isolde’s eyes lit up momentarily, \"Absolutely. Their craft, the plot twist…nothing beats it!\" She was known to vouch for these movies, frequently recommending them to curious customers, as she did now with him. Her deep love for these films was quite apparent as she quoted lines from them frequently, the quotes seamlessly merging into her bar-side conversations.\n \n\n Observing the martial arts weapons mounted on the walls behind the bar, Winston's eyes landed on a wall-mounted sai set. Distinctively, a vacant slot stood in the otherwise complete collection. During the investigation in her bar, a sai from the set was found missing. The rumor circulating was that the sai reported as Guy's murder weapon had eerily similar markings as the ones in Isolde's set.\n \n\n \"Nice collection,\" Winston said, pushing his empty glass forward \"I will have another. Do you also train with these?\"\n \n\n \"Always,\" Isolde responded while working on his drink, pride apparent in her voice. \"I hold a pretty high rank at my martial arts school.\"\n \n\n Moving on to less savory topics, Winston treaded cautiously. He mentioned seeing a few of her offensive posts on social media. Public posts that specialized in racial slander, foul comments directed towards members of Guy's race. Guy had told him about these posts, how they pained him to see such a blatant display of disrespect. They had all heard these derogatory comments, remembered her posting them on that unusually loud megaphone of hers - the internet.\n \n\n Isolde noticeably stiffened but kept her silence, surely aware that these open refusals to serve customers, based on their ethnic backgrounds, had led to a flurry of complaints. Her behavior gave him pause, her hostility towards Guy perceived in her demeanor. Winston sighed, thinking about Guy and his coworkers, who had overheard the hostile conversations during their visits.\n \n\n Winston finished his drink, neatly placing a folded cash note on the table. As he stood up to leave, a sly smile curled up on his lips. This, above everything else, was just the beginning. He exited quietly, leaving Isolde to mull over their conversation and the consequences that might ensue.",

He'd been mulling over the crime scene photos of Guy strewn across the cold shopping mall floor all day - it was a grim sight. The neon clock on the wall read 10 pm, the same time the murder had happened.\n \n\n He shoved the photos in their manila envelope and, clearing his heavy thoughts, he decided to pay a visit to the niece of Guy, Peyton. \n \n\n Reaching the site Peyton worked during her daytime shift, smoke and the clamour of heavy machinery engulfed him. He could see men bustling about the site in hard hats and safety vests. He spotted Peyton in her fluorescent safety vest and hard hat, her face smeared with dust. \n \n\n Observing the bandage-covered wounds, Winston asked, “Are your colleagues, the ones over there, as uninformed as they seem about your injuries?” \n \n\n Peyton gave a shrill laugh before admitting, \"To be honest, they really don't have a clue about it. They're kept in the dark, which is how I prefer it. Some things are better left unspoken, detective.\" With a shrug, she diverted the conversation towards the construction progress.\n \n\n Winston sighed, he'd heard about her evasiveness from her colleagues. \n \n\n A few days later Winston was back, this time at Peyton's martial arts training institute. The instructor was a burly guy, with massive tattooed arms. The man confirmed that Peyton had been training with him and she was proficient in handling a sai. \n \n\n As Winston turned to leave, he asked, “Does she train often?”\n \n\n “Regular as clockwork, she's here weekly. She is, indeed, dedicated.” The instructor replied. \n \n\n Peyton’s dedication found its way to Winston’s mind on his way to her house - the same dedication she put into her hobby. The house was filled with all kinds of trinkets and weapons, but what caught Winston's eye were the sais. Winston could see an empty spot in the case where three sais were supposed to be.\n \n\n “I knew Guy,” she said after a moment of silence, jostling Winston out of his thoughts. “In fact, I was in the same shopping mall that night, you know, just for shopping.”\n \n\n Winston tilted his head, studying her closely. “Indeed?” \n \n\n “Yes...” She muttered distractedly, “I shop there often. You can say 'shopping' is one of my few indulgences.”\n \n\n Winston nodded, thanked her for her time, and started for his car. There were too many questions bouncing around in his head, so he chose to retreat for the day. \n \n\n As Winston was leaving the driveway, he took one last glance at Peyton's house, “At least one thing’s for sure... she really does love that shopping mall.” He mumbled to himself and drove off into the night.\n \n\n Winston looked at the crime scene photos, strewn across his desk. A shopping mall of all places. And a sai as a murder weapon - the forensic team had already confirmed that it belonged to a set like the one behind Isolde's bar counter. The victim, a decent-looking chap named Guy. His family had reported he frequently voiced displeasure about a certain bartender... a woman named Isolde. He complained about how she would neglect his orders and how she threw racial slurs his way.\n \n\n Guy's coworkers had even confided in Winston that they'd overhead him telling stories of racial slurs made by Isolde. The hostility had elevated to such a degree that Isolde officially refused to serve him a drink, for the reason that he belonged to that certain ethnic background she had indisputable prejudice towards.\n \n\n What was also interesting was that Isolde held a high rank in the local martial arts school. She was a formidable black belter specializing in sai, the very same weapon that ended Guy's life. This revelation deepened Winston's suspicion as he found out that Isolde was seen practicing with sai at her school quite frequently.\n \n\n Winston printed out a map and set a route to pay Isolde a visit at her bar.\n \n\n As he entered the bar, Winston's detective instincts took over, his gaze passing over the customers before finally falling on Isolde, busy at work behind the counter. \"Miss Isolde?\" Winston called, striding up to the bar. \n \n\n Isolde turned, offering a thin smile that didn't meet her eyes. \"At your service.\" \n \n\n He launched into his questioning, starting simple. \"You were working at the time of the murder?\"\n \n\n Isolde nodded, her dark gaze unwavering. \"I work here every day, morning till evening. This is my bar.\"\n \n\n \"And you had Guy here at your bar that day?\" Winston asked.\n \n\n \"He always came here,\" Isolde replied, her gaze shifting to a spot behind Winston's shoulder before confirming, \"Yes, he was here.\"\n \n\n Winston, then, noticed something peculiar. He followed her gaze to an area at the corner of bar. It was a display stand that usually held a pair of sai, one of them was conspicuously missing.\n \n\n Winston pulled out his phone, showing Isolde an image amidst a series of them. It was a CCTV grab. Guy, entering the bar. \n \n\n \"Heard you mentioned Guy was here,\" he said, looping back to his original topic. \"You were seen talking to him, even arguing.\"\n \n\n Isolde sighed, rubbing her thumb over the stained counter. \"I won't lie. We had our disagreements. He wasn't fond of some of my... posts.\"\n \n\n Winston brought up the topic she was alluding to - the derogatory comments she'd posted online about Guy's ethnicity. While Winston couldn't accuse or press suspicion onto her, it was one more piece in the puzzle firmly logged in his mind.\n \n\n Winston ended the questioning with a final request for her to remain cooperative during the ongoing investigation. With a polite nod, Isolde agreed as he left, leaving him under no illusions; this case was far from being cracked.",

He rewound to the point where he noticed Lucy leave the fitness center. The time stamp showed 15 minutes after the coroner's estimated time of death of Tommy, the unfortunate victim.\n \n\n Earlier in the day, Winston had come across an interesting note in the primary investigations. Tommy had been receiving payments from Lucy, presumably to keep some secret that Lucy had unwittingly divulged. Tommy, however, had made known that it wasn't enough... that she needed to pay him a larger sum... a sum she wasn't able to produce.\n \n\n This reality led Winston to pay some attention to Lucy. It turned out, Lucy, a known dancer, had an upcoming practice at the same fitness center on the fateful day of Tommy's demise. Lucy's dance was quite unique--she danced with a shiv, not just as a prop, but as an integral part of her performance, spinning, slashing, and twirling it around.\n \n\n Winston decided to visit the fitness center and found Lucy's signature in the sign-in sheet, marked at the same exact time as Tommy's estimated time of death. The receptionist chipped in, \"Lucy entered here with Tommy that day... this was actually the first time I'd seen them together.\" This suggested that Lucy had no choice but to confront Tommy in an attempt to stop his blackmailing.\n \n\n The revelation about Lucy's professional life and her peculiar dance performances stunned him. The receptionist said, “If her secret was ever exposed, Lucy's career would end disastrously. As for her dance, her use of the shiv as part of her show is quite an expected sight.”\n \n\n Moreover, Winston discovered a faded, grubby envelope in Tommy’s gym locker. It was an anonymous letter, revealing Lucy's secret. Surprisingly, upon comparing Lucy’s signature from the sign-in sheet with the handwriting on the envelope, Winston realized Lucy herself had written the letter. Lucy, it seemed, had accidentally written the letter meant to be anonymous, revealing her secret to Tommy. This sparked a new theory in Winston's mind - Could this all be the result of a terrible mistake gone horribly wrong? Only time, and further inquiry, would reveal the truth.\n \n\n Winston had been at the precinct for hours, studying the late-night murder case, compartmentalizing the facts. He had a murder on his hands, the time of which coincided with the fitness center's evening rush hour. This was the very hour Jacqueline, a nimble and agile septuagenarian, stuck to her solitary routine, a time she never invited anyone to join. He was stringing together every strand of coincidence and building a plausible, provable scenario.\n \n\n Tommy, the aspirational powerhouse of a man, had been on everyone's local lips lately. His audacious views had sparked controversy, but also an unexpected local following that was in the fitness center during evening hours. Yet at the height of his local fame, he had been brutally murdered with a shiv at the fitness center where he was renowned for hitting the weights hard, and importantly, where Jacqueline, the septuagenarian, kept to her solitary exercise routine.\n \n\n Looking at the evidence and timing, it was time for Winston to interview Jacqueline. Jacqueline's routine was predictable as the sunrise. Every evening, like clockwork, she'd rub shoulders with the gym-goers and the late-night Tommy fans; yet outside of the gym, she remained a loner, never inviting anyone to join her evening walks.\n \n\n As he drove to the fitness center, he remembered how the quiet locals had reported hearing regular footsteps outside their homes late at night. This was presumably Jacqueline, a hardened septuagenarian known for her solo walks. The neighborhood itself was bustling with life, people making earnest attempts to stay fit, blowing off steam, or just flocking to see where local heartthrob Tommy worked out.\n \n\n He found Jacqueline engrossed in her warm-up routine. The same lady that neighbors often spotted taking quiet, solo strolls when the rest of the neighborhood would be tucked in bed. \"I am Winston, ma'am. I believe you might have known Mr. Tommy?\"\n \n\n Jacqueline pushed through her stretches, \"Oh, yes. That local loudmouth. We disagreed heavily on politics. I never missed an opportunity to oppose him publicly and even donated against his campaigns. But my walking? That's my own business, and I don't invite anyone on it.\"\n \n\n Her political rallies against Tommy were public knowledge, but Winston's eyes were drawn to a new piece of information - her feet. Jacqueline wore a pair of shoes that were strikingly similar to the specific footprint that attentive neighbors had reported. Winston made a mental note as their conversation continued.\n \n\n \"Well, ma'am, you've been very helpful in shedding light on those late-night footsteps the neighbors were worried about. Hopefully, they'd sleep more peacefully tonight, knowing they were from a friendly neighbor's shoe. If I have any more questions, I will certainly return.\"\n \n\n Jacqueline's curt nod was all the acknowledgement Winston got as he bid her goodbye, her focus now entirely on her exercise session, which had kicked off for the day, the same time that aligned with Tommy's grim end.",

He spotted his suspect, Lucy, practicing one of her dance routines in the corner, just finishing another session of her hauntingly dark paintings.\n \n\n “Ma’am?” Winston lifted his badge out for Lucy to see.\n \n\n She took a break from her routine to meet him, panting slightly. “You looking for Lucy?”\n \n\n “I am,” Winston replied stoically.\n \n\n Lucy chuckled lightly, tucking one hair strand behind her ear. She used her other hand to point towards a door. “I’ll clean up as I usually do after my painting sessions. I'll wash off the red paint from my hands and then we can sit down, alright?” She motioned to her red-stained hands.\n \n\n Winston nodded to the suspect, observing her depart towards the sinks at the corner of the room. “Take your time, ma’am.”\n \n\n Lucy returned a few moments later, now sporting clean hands. They sat down in a nearby seating area. A few stray paintbrushes and a vibrant pallet of red, visible even from afar, seemed to bring her comfort.\n \n\n \"Do you paint?\" Winston asked.\n \n\n She picked up a paintbrush. “Yes, I love it. It's therapeutic. In every stroke, I express my emotions. That's why my art sometimes gets a bit... dark.\" Red is my favorite color. And I like to dance.”\n \n\n She lifted up a shiv she kept alongside her, remarking, \"I use this in my dance performances too. It becomes a part of me.\" \n \n\n Later, Winston produced the anonymous letter sent to Tommy. \"Have you seen this? Tommy claims to have received it.\"\n \n\n Lucy looked away, avoiding his gaze. \"I didn't mean for Tommy to get that letter. It was a mistake.\"\n \n\n She then confessed, \"The truth is...Tommy's been blackmailing me. He said he might let things slide if I gave him a huge sum of money, more than I could afford. I was going to reveal my secret but... that letter wasn't meant for Tommy.\" Lucy's face was filled with regret. \"I didn't have any other way to stop him. I didn't know what to do... I even tried to give a large payment, but it wasn't enough for him.\"\n \n\n She choked back tears, confessing softly, \"My career... it would be over if my secret got out.\"\n \n\n Winston watched her closely as she fought back tears, her hands clenched tightly around her paintbrush and shiv. Winston thanked Lucy for her time, promising to look into her claims.\n \n\n As Winston left the fitness center he stopped to take a look at Lucy's paintings displayed on the walls. They were chilling images of detached body parts, made more unnerving by Lucy's enthusiastic use of the color red.\n \n\n He glanced back, Lucy had resumed dancing, the shiv playing a critical part in her performance. Winston took one last look then made his way out the door, leaving Lucy alone to dance.\n \n\n Winston considered the crime scene: a fitness center. An unlikely place for Tommy to meet his end - on a treadmill no less. Tommy was certainly physically fit, and recently had become quite popular among locals due to his polarizing political views. He was often the subject of public discourse, none more vocal than Jacqueline in her opposition to his ideas.\n \n\n The forensic team gave him the breakdown, a shiv. Winston could only sigh at the gruesomeness of it all. NHS workers giving it their best shot trying to return the room to its former glory. However, whoever was responsible was not the type to make petty mistakes.\n \n\n Jacqueline was next on his visit list. A regular protester at Tommy's rallies, her public denouncements of his political stances were well known. And since the murder had occurred during her workout, it would make sense to hear from her.\n \n\n Jacqueline - a nicely aged woman, apparently physically fit and capable – was a regular at the gym. She trained there every day without fail. That day she was pulling off a routine on a rowing machine with a synchronicity one could compare to a clock tick. \n \n\n \"Do you remember seeing or hearing anything unusual?\" Winston asked.\n \n\n Jacqueline halted her rowing, turning to Winston with a crisp look in her eyes. \"No, detective,\" she said, dabbing a sweat towel on her forehead. \"In fact, it was ironically business as usual.\"\n \n\n Business as usual. In a way, Winston thought, it was. Tommy was known for riling up others, though nothing harmful ever really seemed to come of it. Until now. \n \n\n The talk around town was that Jacqueline had served time for 15 years nearly two decades ago. Interestingly, she'd also studied various forms of self-defense while in prison, and since her release, she had made herself a bastion of physical and mental fortitude.\n \n\n \"People don't change, detective,\" Jacqueline stated, seemingly reading his mind. \"When I was younger I made some bad choices. I've paid for them. We all have a past and mine happens to be a bit darker than others.\"\n \n\n \"And Tommy,\" Jacqueline paused, searching Winston's face, \"He was just like me, just on the other side of the fence. Got too comfortable and careless, people like Tommy have a way of doing that.\"\n \n\n \"All I can say is lots of people contribute to anti-Tommy campaigns, and I have my own ideas. It's free speech, right?\" With unwavering determination, Jacqueline continued her pointed assertions against Tommy, echoing her public remarks. She went back to her rowing routine without missing a beat, her eyes now fixed on the TV that was flashing Tommy's controversial speeches on a news channel.\n \n\n Winston thought for a moment before making his exit. He came across Jacqueline plenty of times, she was a regular - like an everyday murmur with a well-timed routine. Winston left with more questions than answers.",

        "context": "When fitness enthusiast Rufus was found dead from a hunting knife wound at his local gym, it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to interview top suspects Harvey and Sergio, a non‑binary individual, in a baffling murder mystery.\n \n\n Winston rubbed his temples in frustration as he stared at the cold file in front of him, the file of Rufus. The fitness fanatic who'd apparently taken one too many steps on the treadmill. Murdered in his safe haven of a fitness center, of all places. The murder weapon: a hunting knife, savage and oddly out of place in the sterile, health-centered environment. The time of the unfortunate event was firmly during Harvey's regular workout slot.\n \n\n He let out a slow breath and maneuvered his way to the very center of his investigation. The one man who seemed to be the focus of this swirl of confusion: Harvey. \n \n\n Winston located Harvey at the same fitness center, engaged in a heavy workout regime. Harvey was an astronaut, disciplined and rigorously trained, his steely determination ever evident. His expression was of hard-angled concentration as he executed his exercises with habitual precision. \n \n\n \"Seems like you never miss a day, eh, Harvey?\" Winston called out to him, keeping his tone casual. Harvey stopped his workout and turned, his face momentarily losing its studied calm as he registered Rufus' name.\n \n\n \"I...I like keeping a routine,\" Harvey responded, visibly uncomfortable. \"You remember, uh, Rufus? Used to workout same time as me, if I remember correctly.\" Harvey's reply was a forced chuckle, but his eyes were stormy and distant.\n \n\n Then Winston dropped a serious bombshell, “You know, I spoke to Jake the other day. He tells me you told him Rufus had some dirt on you? Something about blackmail?” Harvey flinched at this mention leaving Winston confident that Jake’s words held a nugget of truth.\n \n\n Winston leaned against a workout machine, trying to keep the conversation relaxed. Though he served in outer space, Harvey seemed quite grounded to the fitness center. The astronaut in him always brought him back. It was part of their training, everyone knew that astronauts were masters of more than just astrophysics. Their physical training regime could put the best athletes to shame.\n \n\n In the stream of fitness enthusiasts, Harvey was often an island, preferring to workout alone. Winston observed his familiarity with sharp objects from afar, courtesy of his astronaut training perhaps.\n \n\n \"Got a new combat routine, I see,\" Winston observed, pointing out Harvey's well-practiced form with a knife.\n \n\n \"Needed to practice, Detective,\" Harvey confirmed, showing Winston the knife. \"You never know when you might need it up there...in space.\"\n \n\n Bringing up Rufus was like pressing a trigger. Harvey's face visibly lost color at Rufus' mention, his icy-controlled demeanor cracking slightly. \n \n\n \"Yeah, Rufus...\" He sighed, \"He had some stuff on me.. I mean rumor has it, but... he wouldn't do that to me, you know?\" As fatigue set into his voice, Winston noticed the distress behind Harvey's seemingly simple words. \n \n\n Barreling down, Winston remembered a casual tidbit he'd picked up recently. \"Hunting like your old man now, Harvey?\" \n \n\n Harvey hesitated before answering, \"Yeah, got my own now,\" he said, showcasing the knife again.\n \n\n As Winston watched Harvey resume his solitary workout, the pieces of the puzzle slowly aligned in his mind. He wasn't there yet, but the investigation had certainly taken an interesting new twist. \n \n\n \"Keep in touch, Harvey,\" Winston called, leaving the man to his thoughts and his workout routine that seemed to be solitary for more reasons than one.\n \n\n Detective Winston surveyed the scene: a fitness center turned into a crime scene. Rufus, a regular client at the center, was the unfortunate victim. As he collected evidence, he recalled a pertinent detail: Rufus had a scheduled massage appointment on the day of his demise.\n \n\n Winston turned his attention to the masseur, Sergio. It struck him as peculiar that Sergio was relatively detached from his coworkers. He kept to his routine, arriving, completing his appointments, and leaving without mingling. \n \n\n Sergio's professional commitment was admirable. His clientele had mentioned his silence during the sessions, focusing intently on his work. The private massage rooms, secluded and soundproof, added an extra degree of professionalism to his services.\n \n\n Moving past the massage room, he darted his gaze towards Rufus's wife, who stood to the side, nervously fiddling with her fingers. Winston remembered the rumors surrounding her. She had been allegedly lying about her whereabouts, a fact Rufus had confronted her about. \n \n\n Winston couldn't help but observe the notable chemistry between Sergio and her. They seemed to engage frequently, often spotted together, and spent seemingly endless hours alone despite Sergio's introvert nature. Her phone records held another quirk: Sergio's name appeared excessively.\n \n\n Finally, he strolled over to Sergio who stood silent and distant from the crowd. Even when spoken to, he was a man of few words. Winston had to admire the cryptic façade Sergio managed to maintain, never revealing any personal aspect of his life. \n \n\n A bell chimed, awakening Winston from his musings, indicating the end of an intense workout class nearby. Rufus had a standard fitness regimen, Winston mused, which Sergio was no doubt aware of. He found it fascinating how everything tied together somehow - the isolation, the silence, the silent communication. As he walked away, the heavy fitness center doors clicked shut behind him, sealing away the unsolved puzzle within.",

Flicking through his notes, he quickly exited the stuffy room, needing some fresh air. He noted his destination: a local fitness center where Rufus had been earlier that fateful day before he was shockingly murdered. \n \n\n Once there, he soon found the man he was looking for, Sergio was once a medical student. Now, he works at the fitness center as a masseur and whenever he talked to his customers, he would often discuss his knowledge of anatomy giving them tips on how to minimize muscle strain. Rufus was in fact one of his consistent clients. Sergio would usually pamper him with a massage following Rufus's fitness routine which was conveniently timed to coincide with Rufus's wife's aerobics session in the same fitness center. \n \n\n \"I understand Rufus had a regular appointment here,\" Winston casually inquired, spotting a regimented schedule pegged to the wall.\n \n\n \"Yes, he did,\" Sergio admitted, noticeably relaxing. \"I was actually expecting him today for his massage appointment.\"\n \n\n Winston let the conversation drop, pretending his interest was all but gone. For a moment, there was silence, as Winston took the time to appreciate the kind of privacy offered by the massage rooms. They were indeed isolated and soundproof; useful when customers wanted to unwind, he noted silently.\n \n\n \"I see you're interested in hunting,\" Winston pointed out, motioning at a photo of Sergio brandishing a fearsomely sharp knife, an evident tidbit into the masseur's hobby.\n \n\n Sergio perked up at this, happy to boast of his impressive hunting knife collection which was kept thoroughly maintained and sharpened, ready for hunting any time. \"I've always loved their designs... and their purpose.\" he said, nonchalantly.\n \n\n Suddenly, Winston's attention was then drawn to the relentless chirping of a phone. Tracing the noise, he found it came from Rufus's wife's phone, Sergio's name being stated time and again, dominating her call list. \n \n\n Taking note, he filed this aside for later. Then, he took leave of Sergio and went to question Rufus’s wife. She seemed uneasy, particularly when caught in an apparent lie about her whereabouts. When Rufus had questioned her earlier, she had mentioned being at a supermarket but Winston found her at the fitness center, quietly observing Sergio from a distance. \n \n\n Their intrapersonal dynamics had not gone unnoticed by the other gym members. They were often found joking around flirtatiously, especially when they found themselves alone after Rufus's and her fitness sessions.\n \n\n \"Thank you for your time, ma'am,\" Winston tipped off his hat slightly, making a note of the way she frequently looked past him to where Sergio was standing.\n \n\n Upon returning to his car at the parking lot, Winston lit a cigarette, releasing the breath he had been holding, feeling as though he was making progress. It might not have been significant just yet, but every little bit piled into the evidence he would need.\n \n\n A cup of black coffee stood before Winston as he poured over a collected pile of credit card statements. \"What kind of astronaut reads this much?\" Winston murmurs to himself, noticing that most of the charges were made to the same handful of bookstores. \n \n\n Winston set the statements to the side and pulled out a notebook, turning to a page marked 'Harvey.' According to various circles, Rufus had some undisclosed material that could potentially harm Harvey's career. That was the real elephant in the room no one wanted to acknowledge. \n \n\n Reluctantly, Harvey had confessed to Winston during one of their conversations. \"Rufus is blackmailing me,\" he'd admitted, his face pale and distressed.\n \n\n Later that day, Winston found himself at the local National Aeronautics and Space Administration center. His plan was to visit Harvey's training hall, where astronauts were trained in the use of sharp objects as tools, something which Harvey was quite skilled at. In fact, Harvey even owned his personal hunting knife which he used for various tasks. Winston's visit was unexpected, but they were nice enough to give him a tour. \n \n\n At the training center, Winston saw Harvey's knife laying among other sharp tools. He was also made aware of the physical and combat regimen undergone by astronauts such as Harvey. Wandering into the equipment room, he noticed an Anaheim Ducks team-autographed poster, a trinket from former NHL alumni games, and various sharp tools.\n \n\n Winston spent the afternoon with Harvey over a cup of coffee at a local diner. Harvey fidgeted with his cup and looked around the room nervously at the mention of Rufus, revealing how Rufus's potential blackmail had distressed him. \n \n\n Being an astronaut, Winston had expected Harvey to talk about the cosmos, space, and maybe the aliens he secretly hoped existed. Instead, Harvey, whose colleagues had reported that his favourite topic was death, consistently diverted the conversation to discussions of mortality - a topic he apparently enjoyed discussing even in casual settings.\n \n\n Unsettled by the interactions, Winston continued investigating and researched Harvey further. He discovered that Harvey spent most of his free time wandering around local bookstores. The fact that he made purchases at these bookstores tied the pieces of the puzzle more tightly. \n \n\n As Winston sifted through the information, he couldn't help but focus on the nervous demeanor Harvey displayed. Even as a hardened astronaut, whatever Rufus held over Harvey was enough to visibly shake his otherwise calm demeanor. The late-night study sessions continued... As did Winston's analysis, but answers continued to elude him.",

        "context": "In the dim light of an abandoned factory, Kaylee's lifeless body lay with the cold steel of a pickaxe lodged within, thrusting Detective Winston into a dark game of deception with suspects Penelope and Francis, who identifies as non‑binary,.\n \n\n Detective Winston sat at the precinct and scrutinized the last seen diary of Kaylee, a murder victim. The diary, full of Kaylee's secrets, revealed her confrontation with Penelope. She had discovered Penelope’s criminal past and had explicitly written that she was going to expose this to the parents of the children for whom Penelope worked as a nanny. \n \n\n Through the diary, he also knew about Kaylee’s planned meeting with Penelope at the old, abandoned factory; there were no other events slated for that day.\n \n\n With a sense of urgency, Detective Winston decided it was time to visit Penelope. As he arrived at her elegant residence, he marked its close proximity to the abandoned factory. Their locations made it plausible for Penelope to have walked from her home at about the time estimated for the murder. A neighbor had even mentioned seeing Penelope leave her house around that time, which made him more suspicious.\n \n\n \"Hello, Penelope,\" Detective Winston extended a curt greeting to the lady of the house. \n \n\n \"Hello Detective,\" she offered a polite smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. \n \n\n \"As you know, we are here regarding Kaylee's murder,” said Winston in a low voice. \n \n\n Penelope’s face turned pale, “Oh yes, such a tragedy… Kaylee was such a sweet girl…”\n \n\n Winston continued his questioning, “It seems like Kaylee threatened to expose your criminal past, Penelope. According to her diary, she found out and was on the brink of telling the parents of the children under your care. Did you know about that?”\n \n\n Penelope failed to hide the fear flashing in her eyes. Winston took in the opulent house and her genteel demeanor, recognizing the value she placed on her reputation and job as a nanny. The exposure of her criminal past could result in severe humiliation and she could lose her standing in the community.\n \n\n Penelope's neighbor, who'd earlier mentioned seeing her leave the house, had also seen her with a pickaxe a few times recently around the same location. Winston found it hard to dismiss the coincidence when considering the murder weapon was an old mining pickaxe that matched the one Penelope was seen with.\n \n\n Exiting the house, Winston mused about the connections he’d established. He'd confirmed that Penelope was seen leaving her house around the same time as the murder. The weapon matched the pickaxe she'd been seen with. And Kaylee’s diary affirmed her plan to expose Penelope—threats that must have seemed more than idle to a woman who placed such a high value on her reputation and job.\n \n\n As afternoon slipped into dusk, Winston felt that he had advanced a few steps closer to solving the grim puzzle.\n \n\n Detective Winston was thumbing through a stack of reports. The murder of Kaylee had him running in a million different directions. A key detail caught his eye - Kaylee loved to bully, specifically Francis's daughter, probably knew the girl was experiencing depression and anxiety, and took pleasure out of making life miserable for the kid. \n \n\n Reviewing the testimonies of various key persons, he found one by Jane who met a man named Frank, whose physical and behavioral description matched that of Francis. Winston raised an eyebrow, even more, when he found Mary's account. Though her statement identified the man as 'Freddy', all facts pointed directly to Francis. Winston decided to pay a visit to Francis, Kaylee's husband. \n \n\n As the detective rolled up to the family home, out walked a middle-aged man, abruptly ending a phone conversation to greet him. \n \n\n \"Ah, you must be Freddy,\" Winston queried casually.\n \n\n \"Oh, no, you got it wrong. My name's Francis,\" the man corrected with an uneasy grin. \n \n\n The conversation shifted towards the troublesome relationship between Kaylee and Francis's daughter. Francis admitted he had recently caught Kaylee in one of her cruel tirades towards his daughter. This revelation seemed to disarm the husband, who agreed to arrange a confrontation with Kaylee.\n \n\n Careful investigation further revealed that the chosen rendezvous point was an abandoned factory. An eccentric choice, but not entirely unreasonable to Francis, who was knowledgeable about the timings when the factory would be devoid of any workers. An abandoned factory offered privacy, secrecy that could not be achieved in a public space. Francis then revealed that he had persuaded Kaylee to meet him there.\n \n\n Looking at all the evidence, it's apparent Kaylee trusted her husband unquestioningly. This made Winston wonder whether she ever questioned Francis about the odd meeting place or if Francis's trust overpowered her doubts. \n \n\n Before leaving, however, Winston brought up something else that had been bothering him. In his possession were two hotel registries with peculiar entries: one signed as 'Daniel Smith' on August 12th, the other as 'Bill Norman' on August 5th. Events that were extremely out of the ordinary for the residents of the Grand Star Hotel.\n \n\n \"You ever been to the Grand Star Hotel?\" Winston asked Francis.\n \n\n Francis looked puzzled, \"No, can't say I have.\"\n \n\n \"But you signed the registries as 'Daniel Smith' on August 12th and 'Bill Norman' on August 5th. I’ve checked and the physical descriptions match yours perfectly. Do you have anything to say?\"\n \n\n Francis appeared even more confused as the detective got into his car leaving him seemingly bewildered by the line of questioning. However, Winston knew there was much more to investigate. In any case, he now had fresh leads to follow.",

The day had been anything but a usual one and he reviewed the paper on his clipboard yet again. Kaylee, a young woman, was found dead in an abandoned factory of all places and the purported weapon was a pickaxe, an old miner's pickaxe to be exact.\n \n\n His next interview was scheduled with a nanny named Penelope. Penelope was not your average nanny. Alongside her formal education in early child care, she also had professional training in the same field, acquiring skills that allowed her to excel in handling children. Despite her credible qualifications, Winston found it decidedly strange to connect a nanny with such a gruesome find, not least because Penelope herself had most of her busy day spent with children, not in an old factory.\n \n\n After a short walk, he approached a modest suburban home quite close to the abandoned factory. The home itself, despite its proximity, seemed worlds apart from the grim discovery location. \n \n\n Penelope greeted him at the door, shaking his hand with a warm smile. \"Hello, Penelope.\" Winston greeted, then a thought hit him. A person of her profession is typically responsible for a child's growth and upbringing. Penelope's studied and trained background in childcare had indeed stuck in his mind since their last encounter.\n \n\n During their conversation, Winston learned that Penelope was seen leaving her house around the estimated time of the murder. Interestingly enough, he even had a witness claiming to see Penelope with an old mining pickaxe earlier that day, a claim solidly backed up as the recovered pickaxe, the very same weapon used in the murder, matched exactly the one described by the witness.\n \n\n Just as he was thinking about the pickaxe, a piece of evidence from the crime scene flashed across his mind. Winston reached into his jacket pocket to pull out a page from a diary. It was from Kaylee's diary. The entry was clear; Kaylee had a meeting scheduled with Penelope at the so-called abandoned factory.\n \n\n A unease washed over Winston, making the usually delicious coffee taste sour in his mouth. Kaylee seemed to have known something about Penelope that she didn't want public. She had unearthed something about Penelope's past... maybe even criminal past. The parents didn't know... and Kaylee was planning to tell.\n \n\n He glanced at Penelope, who was sitting across from him, looking anxious. She must've known that the exposure would cause her serious embarrassment... and at worst, cost her her job. With no other events reported that could have prevented Kaylee from meeting Penelope, it all looped back to the meeting at the factory.\n \n\n \"Well, Penelope, I do have a long walk back to my car.\" he said, finishing the last of his coffee and standing up. \"I've taken enough of your time, thank you for your cooperation.\" He gave a nod as he reached the door, leaving the nanny to contemplate her day filled with children, and his with unanswered questions.\n \n\n Detective Winston grimaced, finally setting down the carefully documented police case file of the late Kaylee. The coffee stains on the file folder began to bleed into the corners of the cover. The pangs of guilt for indulging in too much work in the form of an overbrewed cup of joe were not his only concern. An image haunted him; it was from a video footage where Francis had caught Kaylee red-handed, threatening his daughter which he digitally recorded as proof.\n \n\n Shaking the sudden chill from his spine, Winston looked out of his office window to the abandoned factory where Kaylee had been found. Francis, Kaylee's husband, had years of mining experience and was renowned for his pickaxe expertise. Francis had arranged the meeting point and was seen coaxing her into trusting that the factory would be undisturbed.\n \n\n The town had all been abuzz with this unthinkable murder. Kaylee's constant torment of Francis' daughter, enough to induce anxiety and depression in the child, was now common knowledge. Even more upsetting was the unusual delicateness Francis had shown in handling this situation, a man known for his work involving grueling physical labor that required a high level of strength and endurance.\n \n\n Digging into his pocket Winston pulled out the receipt for the pickaxe that he'd found in Francis’ pocket, a peculiar coincidence considering Francis’ mining background and the tool associated with it.\n \n\n In the corner of his foul-smelling, second-hand leather bound desk was a photograph. A crisp, clear frame showing Francis purchasing the said pickaxe at the local hardware store. It was not surprising that Francis had chosen to arm himself with a tool he was already so familiar with, but to invite his wife into a murderous trap of his creation was another level of distressing reality.\n \n\n Winston looked up to see Francis standing in the doorway, tall and solemn. \"Detective Winston,\" he said quietly, \"We need to talk about Kaylee.\"\n \n\n Winston nodded, gesturing for him to take a seat. \"I heard about what happened. About the threats she made to your daughter.\"\n \n\n Francis looked taken aback, his gaze shifting around the room. \"Yes...I caught her threatening our daughter. I don't know why she couldn't see what her actions were doing to our daughter.\"\n \n\n Winston nodded but said nothing. He stayed silent, letting Francis explain in his own time, about the factory meeting he'd arranged with Kaylee, his knowledge that the factory would have been empty at that time, the purchased pickaxe and the chilling threats Kaylee had aimed towards his daughter.\n \n\n As Francis left his office, Winston glanced back at the file, picking up the coffee cup, he pondered the gritty mysteries life tended to serve up.",

However, it is not definitively proven that the pickaxe found at the crime scene belongs to Penelope.\n   - Opportunity: Penelope was seen leaving her house around the estimated time of the murder, but there is no evidence that she had access to the abandoned factory at the time of the crime.\n\n2. Francis:\n   - Motive: Francis had a motive to kill Kaylee due to her constant torment of his daughter, which induced anxiety and depression in the child. Additionally, Francis arranged the meeting at the factory, knowing it would be undisturbed, and had a history of mining experience and pickaxe expertise.\n   - Means: Francis purchased the pickaxe that was found at the crime scene, and he had the necessary skills to use it effectively.\n   - Opportunity: Francis had access to the abandoned factory, as he arranged the meeting with Kaylee there, and he was seen coaxing her into trusting that the factory would be undisturbed.\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that Francis has the best established motive, means, and opportunity to have killed Kaylee. Therefore, the most likely murderer is Francis.\n\nANSWER: 2 - Francis.",

        "context": "When fitness enthusiast Uma is ominously murdered with a vial of acid at her local gym, it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to unravel the mystery between the two prime suspects, Irving and Addison, who identifies as non‑binary,.\n \n\n Detective Winston sat hunched over the cold steel counter in the diner, specks of rain slowly dripping onto the vinyl seat from his coat. He absently flipped through the case file of Uma, somehow the atmosphere matching the mournful story he was reading.\n \n\n According to the notes, Uma was a trainer and part-time script consultant at the same fitness center where Irving, the suspect, also trained. Both typically scheduled their workouts late in the evening, customarily ending when the gym was mostly vacant. The evening Uma met her untimely demise, irrefutable evidence shows Irving stayed later than she did, apparently relishing the solitude. The stark lighting of the closed gym only added to the chilly atmosphere.\n \n\n Winston carefully sipped his coffee, the bitter taste pulling him from his reverie. Grabbing his notepad, he jotted down a few points to discuss with Irving. Apart from his regular gym routine, various aspects of his writing career were catching Winston's eye.\n \n\n Irving was known for his precise work on scripts, specifically for his detailed research into harmful substances, even down to their handling and utilization. His alarmingly realistic work had earned him a strange kind of reputation, though no one could deny it fascinated viewers.\n \n\n Given this, Uma’s claim that Irving stole her work didn’t seem so far off. Looking closely at her file again, Winston found a direct threat from Uma stating she would expose Irving's deception to the public. It seemed like this plagiarism accusation had Irving on edge, a tension that seemed to whisper of something dangerous. \n \n\n Heading out of the diner, Winston decided to head over to Irving’s apartment. It was a short drive, the buildings looming against the gloomy sky forebodingly, each window alight as though the eyes of some unseen spectators.\n \n\n As he approached the building, he recalled a report of Irving carrying a vial from his car to his apartment. The vial itself seemed ordinary but combined with his previous online purchases of corrosive substances from a store, it painted a grim picture.\n \n\n Upon reaching the apartment, his observational skills kicked in, the detective noting the absence of lights; Irving had not yet returned home. His mind wandered back to the fitness center, and the reports claiming that Irving usually stayed late rang even truer considering the current time.\n \n\n \"Hey, Winston,\" barked a voice over the phone, pulling him back to reality. \n \n\n \"Irving went home, got caught in the morning traffic. You guess what he drove?\"\n \n\n Winston sighed, the picture painfully clear. \"I'm guessing it was a car.\"\n \n\n \"Well, today's just full of surprises for you, innit? Yeah, it was the car,\" the officer on the other line chuckled before he hung up.\n \n\n Winston leaned against the chilling wall, thoughts whirling around in his mind, the proverbially web becoming denser with each passing moment. Irving had a lot to answer for, and that included what happened the tragic night Uma was murdered.\n \n\n Winston had been to countless crime scenes before, seen unimaginable horrors, yet the fitness center was an unusual one. Uma, one of the well-known fitness enthusiasts had died an inexplicable death. While the cause of her demise was a vial of some sort of acid, the question of 'who?' lingered. He got to work, starting with the first person on his suspect list - Addison, Uma's trainer.\n \n\n Addison was a common sight at the fitness center, employed as a personal trainer. He always had a smile for everyone, but today, his face held a grimace. \"Not the best day, huh?\" Winston began, attempting to ease into the conversation. \n \n\n Addison shrugged, his customary smile replaced with a glowering look. Winston pondered silently also absorbing the sight of Addison's custom-made suit. Just a few days ago, Addison had showcased it during a workout demonstration at the fitness center. Quite an unlikely expenditure for a trainer, he thought, especially considering the known fact that Addison was not particularly well paid for his occupation.\n \n\n \"You remember working with Uma?\" Winston questioned. Addison nodded, confirming that Uma was indeed one of his regular clients. He also mentioned how Uma had once publicly praised his honesty. The irony of the statement was not lost on Winston. There were rumors, after all, that it was Uma who had caught Addison stealing expensive equipment from the gym. \n \n\n \"Equipment going missing recently?\" The question was straightforward, and Addison's look confirmed the hunch. Addison admitted to the gym's problem with missing expensive equipment, his face darkening considerably. The management had also noticed the problem, apparently. Winston suppressed the urge to connect the dots, to voice his suspicions, but rather, he asked brighter questions. Like if Addison ever needed to travel for work, to which the management and Addison himself confirmed that his job did not entail any work-related travel.\n \n\n There was the security footage, of course. Addison entering the gym, nonchalantly, almost cheerfully, shortly before Uma's death. And more importantly, Addison was present in the fitness center at the time of the murder. That was no secret. And yet all Winston could outwardly do was take in the facts as they came, not utter a word about his growing suspicions. \n \n\n \"Quite a suit you've got,\" Winston finally commented at the end of their conversation, his gaze traveling over the custom-made suit that Addison had shown off in his recent work presentation. Addison just nodded, a baleful look crossing his face, as Winston, satisfied for the time, bade him goodbye.",

        "context": "When fitness enthusiast Uma is ominously murdered with a vial of acid at her local gym, it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to unravel the mystery between the two prime suspects, Irving, a proudly non‑binary person, and Addison.\n \n\n Detective Winston was indoors on another stifling California afternoon. His attention was fixed on the Irving case, a case that kept him on his toes for several days now. A screenwriter suspected in the murder of a fellow gym goer. He couldn’t help but feel the increasing pressure of the time crunch.\n \n\n Irving was not an ordinary man. Winston had discovered from the interviews and police records that the guy particularly had some weird habits. Irving, it seemed, was battling insomnia and was unable to sleep in his own home at night. During these restless nights, he would busy himself with his notebooks. Often, he was seen at the fitness center, sketching intriguing symbols into his notebook, which he always carried along with his pencil. He would leave home with these immediately after sunset.\n \n\n One specific detail that struck the detective was Irving's fascination with themes and symbols of the past, particularly those formed by ancient gravestones. These ancient symbols were found in notations and sketches strewn across his notebooks. It was curious to Winston how an old world art found a home in the hands of a modern screenwriter.\n \n\n His insomniac late-night habits weren't the only thing that raised suspicions, though. Irving also was a member at the same fitness center Uma frequented, spotted regularly training late into the night. The very same fitness center that was the scene of the crime. The records substantiated his presence late on the night of the murder. Like the deceased Uma, he seemed to utilized the solitude that the near-empty gym provided, allowing him ample time alone.\n \n\n The lines on Winston's forehead became more pronounced as he read on. He found a strange connection between both Uma's and Irving's lives. Not only did they work out at the same gym, but they also shared a professional conflict. Reports indicated that Uma had discovered Irving's success was largely built on her own work which he'd plagiarized. Fearing public humiliation and the definite demise of his screenwriting career, Irving had a lot to lose. To make matters worse for Irving, Uma, the aggrieved, had threatened to expose his deceit to the public.\n \n\n The tension of the case was truly weighing on Winston. He sighed, leaning back from his desk. Questions in his mind demanded answers that weren't there yet. So, he decided to continue with the investigation, waiting for the breakthrough that would add some clarity to the clouded picture. He had a late-night meeting with the prime suspect, Irving, in the pipeline. It was indeed time to probe further and extract some answers from the silence of the night.\n \n\n Detective Winston admired the modern glow of the fitness center that served as his next stop in the investigation. The thudding of footfalls on running machines, the humming of weight machines, and the faint scent of sweat and disinfectant whispered of a place that had teetered on the edge of life and death.\n \n\n \"Lookin' to join?\" came a voice from behind him. He languidly turned to find Addison, the local trainer.\n \n\n \"No. Detective Winston, on official police business,\" he presented his badge.\n \n\n The sour taste of surprise was evident on Addison's face, \"We're an excellent gym with a friendly vibe; it's a shame. You don't say, a detective?\"\n \n\n \"I've checked the fitness center security cameras,\" Winston watched as Addison pressed his lips together, \"Noticed you were entering the gym shortly before time of Uma's death.\"\n \n\n Addison placed a hand on a weight machine, lowering his gaze to his feet. \"Uma? You mean my client, Uma? We were scheduled for a training session that day.\"\n \n\n Winston opened his notebook, scanning his notes, \"You have a background in chemistry, is that right?\"\n \n\n Addison looked up from his shoes, \"Yeah, I even teach it at the high school. Possess a chemistry degree and recently purchased a chemistry set for demonstration.\"\n \n\n \"Interesting. The set contains vials of acid, science class protocol?\" Winston asked, his brow furrowing.\n \n\n \"Absolutely, controlled experiments to teach risk and safety,\" Addison said, transported into the world of academia. The detective noticed a flicker in Addison’s expression as he continued to speak but brushed it off, it meant nothing yet.\n \n\n A few people from the gym had crowded around now. They watched as Winston asked, \"Can you recall Uma saying anything about the honesty of the staff or maybe about any missing equipment?\"\n \n\n \"Well,\" Addison began, rubbing his neck, \"Uma did once vouch for me, said I was honest and commendable, a good character, you know.\" He looked around the room and swallowed. \"And yes, she did mention once about missing equipment. Unfortunately, she also stumbled upon some CCTV footage of me taking some expensive equipment. I had intended to return it, it was a mistake. \"\n \n\n As Winston watched the gym members disperse, he looked back at Addison. \"So, Uma caught you stealing from the fitness center. That must've been uncomfortable for you. It surfaced in the investigation that fitness equipment has been reported missing recently. Uma seemed to have discovered the theft.\"\n \n\n Addison suddenly seemed to find the floor tiles fascinating. \"Uma was a good woman,\" he said quietly. \"It's a shame what happened to her.\"\n \n\n \"Agreed,\" Winston replied, closing his notebook. \"Keep a clear schedule, Addison. We'll be in touch.\"\n \n\n As Winston exited the gym he took one more glance at Addison through the large glass panes. Cold air nipped at his face and Winston pondered the car ride back to the station.",

It wasn't a pleasant read - Charlotte was hardly a pleasant individual. A chunk of the file was dedicated to dozens of threatening messages Charlotte had sent to Deborah, each one more chilling than the last. It also documented instances where Charlotte had been physically and verbally abusive towards Deborah; hitting her in fits of rage and screaming profanities in her face. \n \n\n As he finished the last report, a woman - a shivering woman - approached him. Deborah, the local chauffeur, the singular and exclusive mode of transportation for Charlotte...the woman he had planned to interview next. She was scheduled to pick Charlotte up on the very day the incident had occurred. There wasn't much to her save for the noticeable fear in her eyes and the bruises discreetly hidden under her clothes. \n \n\n As he extended a sympathetic greeting to Deborah, he observed her clutching her mobile phone tightly. She always carried her phone with her, a silent reminder of the threatening messages she received. It wasn't in the moment, but quite often did she seem to retreat into it for respite, even mid-conversation. \"The modern security blanket,\" he mused.\n \n\n \"Deborah, we need to discuss your last interaction with Charlotte,\" he began softly. As he brought up Charlotte's name, he saw Deborah flinch discernibly. There were scars of fear that were still fresh, some of them physical, it seemed, a weathered map of Charlotte's atrocities towards Deborah etched into her psyche and on her body.\n \n\n Peering up briefly from the ground she had diverted her attention to, she confirmed in a whisper, \"Yes detective, I was the last person to see her alive.\"\n \n\n Winston, carefully noting Deborah's often downward gaze when discussing anything personal, led her gently into her house, promising to keep any discussion of abuse and threats brief. Even still, she could hardly keep focused. Any query about her encounters with Charlotte was met with a quick detour to safer topics. Winston sympathized; it was rare to come across a victim of abuse unwillfully enmeshed in the circumstances of their abuser.\n \n\n Her phone buzzed with a new message, and she busily unlocked it, her eyes flickering eagerly for the change in attention. Friends, as Winston noted, often shared her focus with the frequent check of her phone.\n \n\n A neighbor came by, offering her some comfort as well. Winston observed them interact - the perfect chance to bring up the witnessed incidents of abuse. From overheard insults to the occasional audible thud coming from the house when Charlotte would physically lash out, the neighbor painted a grim picture of Deborah's life with Charlotte.\n \n\n Winston recognized the signs instantly, the clear dread of confrontation, the unwillingness to discuss personal matters. \"It's obvious- she's trapped in an abusive relationship,\" he thought to himself. Deborah's reticence made sense - her life was challenging enough without raking over painful memories.\n \n\n But it was clear more than ever - Deborah was cornered. Stranded in a world where she was the victim of Charlotte’s aggression. Her dependence on her mobile phone and career as Charlotte's sole driver showed a desperate attempt to anchor herself to something stable.\n \n\n Sipping his lukewarm coffee, Winston listened more than he talked, realizing just how deep the story ran. In the heart of it was just a simple driver- trapped, abused, and scared. As he left, he hoped in earnest that the case would close soon. There was too much pain left unsaid.\n \n\n A weary Detective Winston sat in the backseat of the unmarked patrol car, watching the home where Letti was currently residing. He still had questions about the murder of Charlotte, questions that were gnawing at him. \n \n\n He remembered speaking with Charlotte's housekeeper who confirmed that earlier that day, Charlotte had invited Letti over for dinner. Witnesses reported seeing Letti enter the victim's house. The housekeeper swore the two of them were alone in the kitchen. It was a space secluded from the rest of the house. Winston chocked it up to Charlotte's need for privacy. \n \n\n Ironically, privacy was something that was now being invaded by the media. They'd been hounding Charlotte, trying to pry the truth out of her. The truth that Letti had possibly wanted to keep in the dark. \n \n\n \"Charlotte told Letti, 'I know what you did',\" the housekeeper revealed during the interview. Winston wondered whether Charlotte knew something about Letti, something dangerous... something worth killing for. \n \n\n Letti's reaction to Charlotte's statement, according to the housekeeper, had been intense. \"The outburst... it was as if Letti was cornered or threatened,\" the housekeeper claimed.\n \n\n As he went over his notes, Winston's thoughts wandered to the security footage he had seen earlier. It was from a pawn shop, a shady establishment known to sell stun guns. The grainy footage dated back to earlier that day showed a woman matching Letti's description. The Pawn Shop's owner confirmed that she'd bought a stun gun.\n \n\n Letti had been taking self-defense classes. After seeing footage from her at a concert, Winston knew Letti could use a stun gun effectively. She wasn't just a groupie; she was more than what she appeared to be, a fact that was becoming painfully clear. \n \n\n After a few more minutes, Winston made his decision. He needed to talk to Letti. He got out of the car, straightened his jacket, and walked towards the house, every fact etched deep into his mind.",

His eyes narrowed in on a peculiar piece of information; Charlotte, the victim, had reportedly been stuffed. \n \n\n \"That's culinary,\" Winston muttered.\n \n\n The morning began with a visit to the local pet store, where Letti, a groupie with a penchant for exotic decor, was often spotted buying various animals. \n \n\n \"You've seen this woman before?\" he asked, flashing his badge and a photograph of Letti towards the shopkeeper. \n \n\n \"Oh, yeah! She comes by often,\" the shopkeeper said cheerfully. \"Always looking for some new pet to tag along with her to those concerts, I guess.\"\n \n\n \"And what happens to these pets?\"\n \n\n The shopkeeper's face contorted, his smile fading slightly. \"Well... They just disappear, don't they? It's odd.\"\n \n\n His next stop was the scene of the murder: a secluded kitchen in Charlotte's home. According to her housekeeper, it was such place which Charlotte and Letti had been seen alone, sharing the early dinner Charlotte had invited her over for.\n \n\n Suddenly, a lead brought him to a Pawn Shop known for its wide array of self-defense equipment, stun guns in particular. Winston slid the security footage into the player, Letti appearing on the screen, her face a match to the shopkeeper's description.\n \n\n She was seen making a purchase, a stun gun catching his trained eye. Making an additional discovery, Winston found a newspaper article, along with some concert footage showing Letti using a stun gun effectively for self-defense during a music event. This was all coming together.\n \n\n Next, he turned towards a report stating Letti had recently signed up for self-defense classes - the kind that teaches stun gun usage. \n \n\n His trail returning him to the pet store, Winston had found out that Letti had been at Charlotte's earlier in the day, according to a tip from a disgruntled neighbor.\n \n\n Upon hearing about the style in which the stuffing was done, detective Winston noted, Letti seemed to recognize it immediately. Could have been a coincidence, could have not; only time would tell.\n  \n Doctor Winston had his work cut out for him, a tangle of clues, and facts left behind, waiting to be pieced together. He could see, however, that the threads of this mystery were starting to knit together. The mystery deepened the more he dug into it, each fact, each clue pulling him further into the complex web spun around the suspect. The only thing left to do was to pull the right string and observe as everything fell into place. With every step, the truth was seemingly closer, yet shrouded with enough obscurity to keep him on his toes.\n \n\n Winston was met with a distressed and nervous-looking woman when he arrived at Charlotte's house. Deborah was shaking, a pitiful sight, as she repeated her claim: \"I was scared, I was really scared of her.\" She was a mess, with trembling hands and a trembling voice, but Winston had seen the proof of her fear in the way Charlotte treated her. Harsh treatment by a woman, once her employer and now her victim.\n \n\n Apparently, Deborah had been scheduled to drive Charlotte that very day; a service she always offered. In all honesty, it seemed Deborah was Charlotte's only method of transportation. Winston couldn't help but wonder, though, at the intensity of her fear. Was it because of Charlotte's abusive behavior, evidenced by bruises and the testimonies of her neighbors? Or was it due to ominous messages that Charlotte had sent Deborah?\n \n\n Deborah's fear seemed to have had a history of manifesting physically. The word was out that she had employed a stun gun in the past, for self-protection as Winston understood. Deborah was never far from it, the weapon always at her side.\n \n\n Just then, Winston noticed a license on her wall. \"Used to be a personal security guard, I see,\" he commented, pointing towards it. Deborah just nodded in agreement, a simple affirmative to Winston's observation. Strange how life can take unexpected turns, Winston thought.\n \n\n \"Deborah,\" Winston started, his tone soothing, \"can you tell me what exactly happened when Charlotte... died?\" Deborah hesitated, her eyes moving towards the stun gun on the table. An eerily similar device was collected from the crime scene.\n \n\n \"Well, I...\" she stammered, \"I, um, was the last person to see her. I... I found her... in the kitchen.\" Her voice was barely audible, a whisper barely able to carry the weight of her confession. \n \n\n Winston didn't say anything. He simply nodded before standing up, thanking Deborah for her time and promising to be in contact. He left the house, lost in his thoughts. There was much to ponder over in this investigation. After all, the puzzle of the case was only just beginning to reveal itself.",

It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\n \n\n After a moment of silence, she casually added, \"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\"\n \n\n Winston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day… right?\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\n \n\n As part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston’s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\n \n\n “Acid isn’t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?”\n \n\n Daisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose’s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\n \n\n As Winston sat in his office, he sifted through the photos of the crime scene. The car where Rose had met her gruesome end was familiar to him - it was the one Dexter had sold her just a few days ago. He recalled the witness statement he had received, stating that Dexter and Rose were seen driving off in the new car together on the day of the sale.\n \n\n A few days prior, he had stopped by the car dealership for a chat with Dexter. The man was always excitable, energetic - the sort of person you'd expect to be selling cars. But beneath that facade, Winston had glimpsed an undertone of tension. A hint of worry, perhaps? He remembered too the bold campaign posters dotting the walls of the showroom - 'Dexter for Office' they proclaimed, his smiling face lit up by the flash of a professional camera. Maintaining a decent public image was crucial for his campaign.\n \n\n \"Beautiful machine, ain't she?\" Dexter had commented, patting the bonnet of the vehicle with an almost reverential air. His eyes had been bright as he spoke, \"Takes skill to appreciate such precision and quality.\"\n \n\n A brief moment of silence had hung over them before Winston mentioned Rose. Instantly, the twitch in Dexter's smile was noticeable as he forced a chuckle, \"She got a good deal on this one. I even had a ride in it with her, that's what earned her trust.\"\n \n\n As a detective, one didn't always have the luxury of trusting words at face value. Dexter seemed too polished - too adept at projecting an image. Most importantly, Winston had known about his run for the local office. A scandal was not what he needed. Rose had found out about Dexter's false credentials, and threatened him with exposure.\n \n\n Winston also remembered the demure set of eyes that stared back at him from an old campus photo during a visit to Dexter's home. Dexter had a degree in Chemistry. Neat rows of labeled chemicals stood proudly on a shelf in his private garage. The detective recognized some of them from his own time in the forensics lab. He had seen the vials labeled 'Acid'. Winston had asked Dexter about the key trace elements for his car sales. Dexter had just brushed it off with a laugh, mentioning they were required for cleaning and various other mundane tasks around the sales lot.\n \n\n Back at his office, the image of the second set of car keys on Dexter's table resurfaced in his mind. Dexter had explained them as a precaution, an insurance if customers ever lost their keys.\n \n\n \"Coffee?\" Winston's assistant knocked on his office door, pulling him out of his thoughts.\n \n\n \"No thanks,\" the detective replied, scribbling something down in his notebook before shuffling his case files together. \"I think I need some fresh air. Let's do a round at the car dealership.\"",

        "context": "In a chilling turn of events, Rose is found lifeless in a car, killed by a vial of acid, leading Detective Winston to the affluent suspects, Daisy and Dexter, a proudly non‑binary person,.\n \n\n Detective Winston found himself in the showroom of a car dealership. He was eyeing one of the employees behind the counter, a man named Dexter. The guy was tall, slender, and had a bright grin, almost always painted across his face. Dexter was seen engrossing himself with trinkets that sat on the edge of his desk. These weren't just ordinary trinkets, many of them were uniquely car-related, including miniature replicas of cars engines and pieces that Dexter had personally worked on with his chemical expertise. He smiled lightly as he fiddled with them.\n \n\n As Winston approached him, Dexter looked up, and his eyes momentarily flickered with recognition before he composed his features into a salesman’s grin. After introducing himself, Winston mentioned Rose and watched for any reactions. But Dexter's face remained impassive, his salesman smile never wavering.\n \n\n Instead of just being a mere salesman, Dexter was also the chief mechanic of the dealership, utilizing his extensive background in chemistry to invent more advanced car maintenance techniques using various chemicals. His clear talent in this area provided him with a unique edge over other car sale businesses. As his shift ended, Dexter led Winston to his home, speaking eagerly about his run for a local office. \n \n\n As they entered Dexter’s living room, Winston noticed a big box sitting against one wall. Piled around it were numerous trinkets, ranging from keychains to pens, from figurines to pocket watches. When Winston enquired about the assortment, Dexter revealed his routine of adding to the box each time he made a new customer. To demonstrate, he showed Winston a trinket he had recently added, telling the detective about the customer he met that day. It was his way of commemorating their interactions.\n \n\n The home was filled with telling signs of his life. One thing that caught Winston's eye was a photo album lying open on the coffee table. It exhibited Dexter with various people, captions scribbled underneath each picture capturing pleasurable memories.\n \n\n Their conversation eventually shifted to Dexter’s basement, and his workspace was introduced. Odd for a car salesman but not for an in-house mechanic, his workspace was filled with extensive glassware and chemicals, including several bottles of acid which Dexter often used in his inventive car mechanic works. He confirmed to Winston about his background in chemistry before becoming a mechanic and eventually a car salesman.\n \n\n Just as Winston was preparing to leave, Dexter mentioned something that instantly shocked him. Rose had threatened to expose him. She had figured out that he had been dishonest about his qualifications. Hiding his surprise, Winston empathically responded, and Dexter merely smiled, affirming how damaging Rose's threats were to his public image and his ongoing electoral campaign.\n \n\n With the resonating echo of Dexter’s last words, Winston bid his goodbyes, exiting with suspicious thoughts playing heavily on his mind. Not only was Dexter's public image important for his election hopes but, as a renowned mechanic, any scandal could also potentially tarnish his reputation within the car dealership.\n \n\n The detective, Winston, had strong coffee in his hand as he reviewed the case files laid out in front of him. His current assignment was the murder of Rose, who was found dead in her car by means of an acid attack. The type of acid was identical to those found in Daisy's performances. The perpetrator got away, leaving only a vial as evidence.\n \n\n Rose had frequent parking spots, and her car was often seen in the lot near the locals' favorite music venue. The night she was killed, she was leaving a concert that was being performed by Daisy, a singer scheduled to perform at the same venue near the parking lot that day. Rose also notably had a sizable life insurance policy, to which Daisy was added as a beneficiary just a month before the incident.\n \n\n Daisy was known for her meticulously neat dressing room. She claimed it came from her aversion to the generally dirty environment the venues offered. Daisy's music album sales had been falling drastically, attested by the revenue charts Winston was scrutinizing. Furthermore, due to the cancellation of many events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Daisy had been unable to collect performance fees.\n \n\n During the middle of the practice session, Winston visited Daisy, where she was preparing for her next performance. He noticed different types of acids in small containers labeled and neatly arranged on a side table. Upon inquiry, Daisy shared how she often incorporated the acids into her performances for dramatic effects. She jokingly added, \"You should see the mess they make sometimes; this place is never clean.\"\n \n\n Witnesses from the concert reported seeing Daisy and Rose leaving the venue together after the show. They appeared to be the only ones in the car. Daisy didn't hesitate to confirm, \"Oh, yes, Rose and I left the venue together. She was kind enough to offer me a lift, as my own ride bailed out.\"\n \n\n As Winston left the venue, his phone buzzed, reminding him of Daisy's recent addition to Rose's sizable life insurance policy just a month ago. As he drove past the venue, he saw that it was right next to the parking lot where Rose frequented. With the vial of similar acid on his mind, the pieces were starting to fall into place for Winston.\n \n\n Despite making some strides, the detective knew that the journey to justice was far from over. Each new location and piece of information held the potential to be the key to unraveling the mystery behind Rose's death.",

        "context": "In the bustling labyrinth of a city mall, a grisly murder sends shockwaves as Xenia is killed with a nail gun, leaving Detective Winston with two perplexing suspects: Van and Wilfred, who uses they/them pronouns,.\n \n\n Detective Winston felt his chest tighten slightly as he stepped onto the crime scene. Another murder, and this time - a shopping mall. Xenia, the victim, a blond woman in her early forties. Falling under the jurisdiction of his detective expertise, Winston gathered the scattered bits of facts and evidence that were available up to this point.\n \n\n The murder weapon, a nail gun, an unusual choice. That fact alone put Winston’s investigation into a small percentage of the population who had access to such tools - contractors. And with this unfortunate coincidence was the fact that the nail gun used in the crime was reported missing from Wilfred's construction project, which made for even a more compelling lead to pursue. \n \n\n Court sessions were known to be highly stressful, creating a complete sense of tension in the courtroom, causing lawyers like Wilfred to sweat profusely. Yet, even under such stressful circumstances Wilfred always maintained a fresh scent.\n \n\n Upon hearing this, his mind immediately turned to Wilfred, a local lawyer who was a known aficionado of construction, something that would give him easy access to nail guns. \n \n\n Winston sent out a request for surveillance footage of Wilfred's construction site, hoping to gain some insight into whether Wilfred had any interaction with nail guns. \n \n\n He also requested the mall’s CCTV footage, given that Xenia was killed in the mall. The footage verified Wilfred’s presence in the mall around the same time Xenia was murdered. But that wasn't the evidence that caught Winston’s eye. It was the traces of bakery flour, always noticeable on Wilfred's shoes. \n \n\n Wilfred was known to spend significant amounts of time on his feet in the courtroom, often sweating profusely due to the stressful court sessions. Yet a remarkable trait about Wilfred was that he maintained a fresh scent, even after a long day. This always intrigued Winston; however, upon further investigation, he discovered Wilfred's secret was the luxury of having a bathroom with a shower in his office; thus the puzzle started to come together.\n \n\n The authorities were unsure of Wilfred's exact location during the murder. Nobody could verify his whereabouts and the time Xenia was killed, Wilfred was unaccounted for, posing a substantial mystery for Winston to solve.\n \n\n As he continued his investigation, Winston implemented a strategic approach to obtain more information. He planned a meeting with Wilfred under the pretext of discussing a case, and at the scheduled meeting, he carefully observed the unassuming lawyer.\n \n\n \"When's the last time you visited your construction project, Wilfred?\" Winston asked, keeping a close eye on the man's reactions.\n \n\n \"Monday, as I recall,\" Wilfred responded, not missing a beat. \"Why do you ask?\"\n \n\n \"Just curiosity. You ever handle a nail gun before?\"\n \n\n Wilfred offered a nonchalant shrug. \"Sure. Comes with the territory.\"\n \n\n Winston noted the answer, pressing further. \"And how about the mall? Been there recently?”\n \n\n Wilfred nodded, stating, \"Oh, yes, a couple of times this week.\"\n \n\n In the end, Winston came out of the meeting with more questions than answers, but the strings of information were beginning to shape a premise. One thing was certain - Wilfred was irrefutably intertwined in this case.\n \n\n Winston swept through the shopping mall like water, eyes scanning, earpiece transmitting information straight to the station. He was looking for Van, who had been on shift when Xenia was killed.\n \n\n He spotted a muscular man with a nametag was unloading boxes from a service entrance, huffing and puffing as he went. \"Looks like our guy,\" he mumbled into his headset.\n \n\n \"I've been expecting you,\" said Van, the bodybuilder, wiping his sweat-drenched forehead with a well-charred sleeve. He pointed to a chair across the table, \"Have a seat, will you?\"\n \n\n Winston did, and before he even opened his mouth, Van was speaking, \"You know, Xenia was here almost every day. She loved this place, loved shopping. Sad thing what happened.\"\n \n\n Winston, not one for small talk, started grilling Van, \"You were on shift when she was killed, right Van?\"\n \n\n \"Yeah, I was,\" he replied. \"I ain't seen nothing though.\"\n \n\n \"What does your job entail?\" Winston asked, changing the subject.\n \n\n \"I've got free run of this place. Lock, stock and barrel, I can move about as I please,” Van said, directing an intense look at Winston's face.  \n \n\n \"Your hobbies, Van?\" \n \n\n \"Used to build furniture for a living,\" He admitted, \"It was a bit of an obsession for a while. Even took a safety course from the local construction company.\"\n \n\n \"Did you now,\" Winston nodded, “Do you happen to own a nail gun?”\n \n\n “Bought one recently, yes,” Van said, as casually as if he were talking about the weather. “Receipt’s right here in my wallet.”\n \n\n \"Thanks for sharing. Are you aware that Xenia recently updated her will, making you the sole beneficiary?” The detective shifted the conversation back onto Xenia.\n \n\n “It’s funny you say that, because I did have her change her life insurance policy at the same time,” Van shared, ”I hadn’t thought of it… till now…” He paused, looking contemplative for a moment. \n \n\n Winston got a call that disturbed him, \"Excuse me, I must go.”\n \n\n He remembered the mail they found at Van’s house: confirmation from the hardware store of buying a nail gun the same model as the murder weapon. It added up.\n \n\n Before leaving, Winston couldn't help but casually ask, \"The insurance payout from her will, that a large sum?\"\n \n\n \"God-awful massive,\" Van answered after a moment of hesitation, \"And here I am buried under... well, a heap of bills, I'd rather not disclose.\"\n \n\n With that, the detective left, collecting the pieces as he went.",

This was Van, Xenia's accountant, the man whose name is repeated within the pages of her recent will and life insurance policy changes, as sole beneficiary. \n \n\n Van possessed an imposing frame, earned through countless hours in the gym, evidenced not only by his physique, but by the common knowledge that when not immersed in numerical acrobatics for his clients, Van was often pumping iron. His impressive devotion to physical fitness was a topic of conversation in many social circles, where he was frequently invited but always declined the invitations. Those who knew him joked about how he replaces the traditional 'work hard, play hard' with 'work hard, lift harder'.\n \n\n A fresh stream of tobacco smoke curled lazily from Winston's cigarette, the detective registered Van's behavior, quiet with a touch of aloofness. It piqued Winston's interest when the burly accountant was asked by a mutual acquaintance about his dating life, he deftly switched the topic to his recent smash of weightlifting records.\n \n\n Van, it seemed, preferred to shy away from social gatherings and personal inquiries, focusing on his private world of numbers and weights. It was quite a departure from his previous interest in furniture crafting where he had even enrolled in the course on construction safety to hone his hands-on skills.\n \n\n All these were pieces of a puzzle Winston was trying to solve, yet there were occasional pieces that invariably stood out, like the receipt of a nail gun purchase Winston had found in Van's wallet and then confirmed by mail from the hardware store.\n \n\n The same model nail gun, as the one used to end Xenia's life. A curious coincidence. And with Xenia's vast insurance payout at play and Van's trigger-happy finger on her life insurance policy alteration, Winston prodded further into Van's possible involvement. \n \n\n He couldn't ignore the specter of Van's towering debts that strayed too close, too often into the spotlight, even this brief encounter.\n \n\n Winston had come a long way in his career, and he realized he had barely scratched the surface with this accountant. A man who lived in numbers, and died by them.\n \n\n Winston had spent all day at the busy crime scene at the local shopping mall – a gruesome scene with the victim Xenia, killed by a nail gun. Winston was hunting for leads to a suspect rumored to be a local lawyer turned aspiring politician. The bell on the mall entry chimed and in he walked, Wilfred. \n \n\n “Howdy Wilfred,” Winston said with a nod, recognizing him from local election debates. \n \n\n “Detective Winston...” Wilfred replied with a light bitter edge to his voice, “I trust you have everything in hand here?”\n \n\n “Looking into it very thoroughly, Sir, as I’m sure you’d want,” Winston replied with a subtle hint of sarcasm. \n \n\n “Aren't I aware of a construction project you're involved with?” Winston asked, remembering Wilfred’s role in city development. He also added, \"I remember you said you worked in the field before turning to law. And you mentioned you were especially adept with using nail guns in your construction work. That’s correct, isn't it?\" \n \n\n Wilfred hesitated, “Yes, that there is part of my campaign portfolio. I used to be in construction, yes. And I did favor the use of nail guns over other tools.\"\n \n\n “I see, so you've had first-hand experience with construction work?”\n \n\n Wilfred nodded in agreement and Winston continued, “I heard there was a nail gun missing from your site. A tool you're quite familiar with, am I right?”\n \n\n Wilfred’s face went pale, “Why, yes, there was. We reported it...\"\n \n\n Before Wilfred could complete his sentence, Winston cut in, “Do you remember Xenia?”\n \n\n “She had some wild accusations,” Wilfred stuttered, trying to hide his irritation, “She threatened to throw some trash into my election campaign.”\n \n\n “And I also heard,” Winston added, \"that she was actually explicit about her plans. In fact, she told you directly that she was going to expose your scandal, didn't she?\"\n \n\n Wilfred’s face turned paler, “Well, yes, she did. But--”\n \n\n Winston grinned, \"Not just trash, Wilfred. She had physical evidence. Documents proving your indiscretion.\"\n \n\n Wilfred gulped. Winston continued, “Her murder coincidentally took place during your unaccounted for period.”\n \n\n Despite the clear unease on his face, Wilfred sputtered, “I… I… That's impossible. I… I can prove my whereabouts.”\n \n\n “Well, Sir\" Winston said, shifting slightly to reveal the mall’s security camera pointing directly at them, \"you may have to explain why you, Mr. Wilfred, have been spotted on our CCTV not too long ago, roughly at the same time Xenia was found murdered. And let’s not forget about your high proficiency with nail guns.”\n \n\n Before Wilfred had a chance to reply, Winston pulled his hat down over his eyes and walked away, leaving Wilfred in the middle of the bustling shopping mall.",

        "context": "When Wendy's life brutally ended under the sharp end of a pickaxe at the local roller rink, it was up to the shrewd Detective Winston to untangle the web spun around two prime suspects, Marianne and Sidney, a proudly non‑binary person,.\n \n\n Detective Winston tapped his pen against the mugshot of Marianne. She wore the hardened expression of a seasoned miner, and a sprinkle of white dust beaded her forehead. She had, years ago, spent a considerable amount of time underground before she traded the pickaxe for a ring. Even after her marriage, however, Winston knew that Marianne was not unfamiliar with the heft and purpose of such a tool.\n \n\n His eyes consisted of the audit papers laid out before him, declaring a significant debt that Marianne owed in back taxes. She was circling financial demise, and the state was closing in. Then, his eyes shifted to the statement provided by a friend of hers, highlighting her strong assertion that she would rather perish than get sent behind bars. It seemed to Winston that Marianne was still filled with the spirits of the old miners, willing to risk it all in pursuit of her own freedom.\n \n\n His venture out to her parcel of land a few days back had stamped the image in his mind of her mining tools lounging out in the open. They were well-kept and clean, the way old miners kept their tools. Marianne had been spotted around the community with the pickaxe, using it for various garden works and general maintenance.\n \n\n Now Winston's attention moved to Wendy, the victim, an honest lady known for her earnest ways. She was found in a sequestered section of the roller rink, a roller skate still hanging onto her foot as if she was frozen mid-skate.\n \n\n Placing a call, Winston requested the CCTV footage of the roller rink from the night of the murder. There, in the flickering low resolution, was Wendy locked in a heated argument with Marianne. The dispute ended and Wendy skated off, but Marianne stayed.\n \n\n Later, another clip showed Marianne lingering along the outskirts, long after the other skaters had left. It was an eerie sight - the roller rink was empty, except for the flickering neon lights and Marianne, circling the rink with an unsettling calmness.\n \n\n Winston slid an envelope towards himself and carefully extracted a photograph. It was Wendy's last piece of brave detective work - a picture of Marianne caught in a grim action that served as undeniable proof of her crime. But it was Wendy, with her unwavering integrity, who held this tight to her chest, vowing to expose the truth about Marianne.\n \n\n Two cups of coffee empty, Winston switched off the lights and left the room. The image of Marianne and the pickaxe lingered in the darkness of the office, the unsaid words and whispers of the CCTV footage bouncing off the walls. The unwelcome truth seemed to have found a perfect partner with the impending dawn, unflinching and relentless.\n \n\n Pencil in hand, a room full of boxes filled with countless pads of stationary and envelopes, Winston scrolled through the dossier one more time. Sidney, the geologist who loved to write letters and the company of a well-worn roller rink.\n \n\n Winston headed to the local rink to further his investigation. The sticky, stale scent of overused roller skates greeting him as he walked in. The roller rink was bustling with murmurs about the murder that had taken place there the previous night during Sidney's usual hours at the rink, further thickening the air with tension.\n \n\n The staff recognized him the second he walked through the door. \"Detective Winston,\" they greeted. \"Come about the Sidney matter?\" \n \n\n Winston nodded, face impassive, “He’s a regular around here, isn’t he? And he was here last night too?\"\n \n\n “Heck, we'd see him here every other night, including last night,” one replied. \"Always came in right around the same time.” Winston noted the staff’s response verbatim.\n \n\n “And this uh…Wendy? Seen her around with Sidney?” \n \n\n Pausing, a staff member nodded. \"Yes, they've been seen together few times at the rink. Wendy told us she knew a secret about Sidney, something that could humiliate him if it got out and that she already shared this secret with her friends. In fact, the secret she told was indeed damaging; it was about Sidney's misconduct in his reputable profession that if revealed, would certainly ruin him publicly.\"\n \n\n The information tucked away in his mind, Winston thanked the rink staff. He turned his mind to Jack, Sidney’s imprisoned friend with notorious criminal record.\n \n\n He walked out to his car, rummaging for his mobile, tapped a number. \"Yes, I need to speak with Jack. Yes, the one in cell 108.\"\n \n\n The next stop was the post office, where stacks upon stacks of letters, each written by Sidney using his large collection of stationary and postage stamps could be seen. \"Yeah, he's in here often,” the postmistress shared without hesitation. \n \n\n Winston mulled over this, pocketed his notepad, and headed to Sidney's home with a stern knock on the door.\n \n\n Sidney let him in, launching into endless stories involving Jack as if it were an unconcerned topic. But when Wendy's name dropped, his jovial manner evaporated and his demeanor drastically changed. \"That's a lie!\" Sidney protested vehemently when Winston cautiously picked up the subject Wendy had told her friends involving a ruinous secret that's been said she knew about Sidney. \"She had no idea what she was talking about. All her talk was to intentionally defame me in public.\" The denial was fervent, almost desperate.\n \n\n Winston offered no consolation. It wasn’t his job. He stepped away from Sidney’s house, a new puzzle piece in hand. His work, the unraveling of the truth, was far from done.",

Marianne:\n   - Motive: Marianne was in financial trouble due to her back taxes, and she had expressed a willingness to risk everything to maintain her freedom. Wendy knew a secret about Marianne that could potentially ruin her, which could be seen as a motive for Marianne to eliminate Wendy.\n   - Means: Marianne was familiar with the use of a pickaxe, having used one in her mining days. She also had the pickaxe readily available at her property.\n   - Opportunity: Marianne was at the roller rink the night of the murder, as seen on the CCTV footage. She also had the opportunity to confront Wendy privately after their argument, as Wendy skated off, but Marianne remained. Later, Marianne was seen lingering alone at the rink long after everyone else had left.\n\n2. Sidney:\n   - Motive: While it's not explicitly stated that Sidney had a motive to kill Wendy, it's worth noting that Wendy knew a secret about Sidney that could potentially ruin him publicly. This secret, if revealed, could have significant consequences for Sidney's reputation and career.\n   - Means: Sidney does not have a history of using a pickaxe, and there's no evidence suggesting he had access to one.\n   - Opportunity: Sidney was a regular at the roller rink, including the night of the murder. However, there's no direct evidence placing him at the crime scene or suggesting he had the opportunity to confront Wendy privately.\n\nComparing the two suspects, Marianne seems to have a stronger case for motive, means, and opportunity. While Sidney may have a motive due to Wendy's knowledge of his secret, this motive is not as clearly established as Marianne's financial troubles and desire to maintain her freedom. Additionally, Marianne has a history of using a pickaxe, and she had the pickaxe readily available at her property.

        "context": "When Wendy's life brutally ended under the sharp end of a pickaxe at the local roller rink, it was up to the shrewd Detective Winston to untangle the web spun around two prime suspects, Marianne, a proudly non‑binary person, and Sidney.\n \n\n Winston ran his fingers through his tangled hair as he fixated on the aged screen of the department’s underfunded monitor. It projected grainy CCTV footage of his suspect - Marianne. She was there at the roller rink, on the night poor Wendy met her end. Not only was Marianne there - she was seen shouting at Wendy, their voices escalating until they pierced the rhythmic hum of the skating wheels. The timestamp of the argument, and subsequent footage of Marianne lingering, suggested she was there for quite some time after her dispute with Wendy.\n \n\n He thumbed through a thin folder tucked beneath a closing pizza box resting on his cluttered desk. Marianne had a criminal record, it revealed a past fraught with moments of explosion, of violence - including an assault arrest five years prior. The Marianne on the screen, the Marianne in these documents had been caught in the wrong before. Winston began to feel a creeping uneasiness as he parsed this correlation. \n \n\n Several pictures tumbled from the folder as Winston shuffled its contents. The pictures were snapshots of Marianne: caught in the midst of her day-to-day, widely recognized by the community - not just for her nature but for her frequent use of an old pickaxe. It came as no surprise since she had spent several years working in the mines before her marriage. She was seen using her pickaxe for numerous tasks such as chopping firewood or loosening soil in her garden. \n \n\n \"Did you see what she was doing last week?\" a seasoned woman down the road had mentioned as she was reversing her car out of the driveway. Marianne was seen cleaning her well-worn mining equipment that she'd kept stored in an easily accessible tool-shed next to her house in clear sight. It seemed she wasn't shy about flaunting her past or the tools she used while in the mines.\n \n\n Commotion at the precinct broke Winston from his thoughts. The crime-scene analyst reported the murder took place in some remote corner of the roller rink. Despite the public dispute that took place earlier between Wendy and Marianne, this location seemed isolated, uncanny for such a busy locale.\n \n\n The analyst's words seemed to chisel further into Winston's thoughts as he returned to the grainy images. Her mining equipment was never far from reach, and Marian's cacophony on the night of Wendy's murder was caught on tape. \n \n\n Pieces started falling into place; too many strings tethered Marianne to the night Wendy was murdered. With a sigh, Winston allowed himself a quiet moment. Then, taking a deep breath, he began his descent into the intricacies of the case before him.\n \n\n Winston stood at the entrance of the roller rink, eyes scanning the room. The images from the crime scene report replayed in his memory. Poor Wendy had breathed her last in what was supposed to be a place filled with the rejuvenating sounds of retro music and flashing lights.\n \n\n Sidney, who was a geologist, had been seen with Wendy at the roller rink multiple times. According to the staff, Sidney was even a regular here. It was a curious detail but not unusual, people had hobbies apart from their professions. Sidney's passion besides analyzing layers of earth was rollerblading. He frequently carried his tools, including his pickaxe, from his daytime geological survey sites directly to the roller rink in the evenings.\n \n\n Checking his notes from the previous conversation with Sidney, his eyebrows knitted slightly as he remembered the desperation he sensed from Sidney. It revolved around Wendy, who apparently knew something he coveted as a secret. She had been sharing this secret with her friends and it seemed it held the power to publicly humiliate Sidney if it ever came to light. Sidney, for his part, vehemently denied any secret of such scale.\n \n\n Winston gestured for the barista to come over. The young man with a skater haircut glanced at Winston's badge before he ordered a black coffee with no sugar. While waiting for his order, he asked, “Did you notice Sidney here during the time of the incident?”\n \n\n The barista nodded, nervously biting his lower lip. \"Yes, Detective. Sidney was here. I remember seeing him.\"\n \n\n Winston nodded as he continued his observations. His gaze lingered over Sidney's station where he parked his geologist’s gear, including his trusted pickaxe, which he used during his geological field trips, when he visited. He noticed the stains of usual wear and tear and a freshly cleaned pickaxe leaning against the wall. Nothing unusual for a geologist. Taking down notes, Winston silently queued the information; the same Pickaxe might have been used for the murder.\n \n\n His phone buzzed breaking his trail of thoughts, He took the informer's call. He glanced at his watch noting down the time of the conversation before disconnecting the call. He finished his coffee and left the roller rink. He had to confirm if Wendy was indeed telling the truth about that secret or Sidney was just an innocent geologist who loved rollerblading and hated gossips.",

        "context": "In the impeccably polished kitchen where Tessa met her fatal end through a deadly gas, Detective Winston starts his journey of dark secrets, questioning Penelope and Melody, who identifies as non‑binary,, the two prime suspects.\n \n\n Winston swept through Tessa's starkly white yet crimson-stained kitchen, pausing over the various chemicals laid across her dining table. The room smelled of cleaners, a scent that clashed with the stark reality of its circumstances - a tragic and untimely death. A photograph on the fridge captured his attention - an image of Tessa, alongside a tall, dark-haired woman who he recognized as Penelope, a local tarot reader.\n \n\n Later on, his investigations led him to the drains where he suspected Penelope's large chemical purchase from the day before had been dumped. The local authorities confirmed it. The incident was also marked by Penelope's unanticipated visit to Tessa's place during which no witness was there to mark her departure. Despite this, a CT-TV camera at the end of Tessa's street had picked up Penelope leaving just before the estimated time of Tessa's death, something that felt unusual given Tessa's friendly, social neighborhood ethos.\n \n\n Penelope's home struck him as a stark counterpoint to Tessa's clean, modern aesthetic. Her decor smacked of a dark gothic undertone, featuring cherubs and pentagrams. The display left no doubt about Penelope’s approximation towards medieval tarot readers and alchemists which was further solidified by her quirky ornaments and stacks of intimidating books.\n \n\n Winston pointed out a book lying open on a nearby table, which displayed disturbing diagrams and descriptions of different poisonous gases. \n \n\n \"What's this here?\" Winston asked, pointing at it.\n \n\n \"O-oh, I was...reading it for a character in my book,\" Penelope stammered.\n \n\n Shifting in her seat, Penelope added, \"A character who thinks they can commit the perfect crime, leaving no traces.\"\n \n\n \"Their own idea of justice, perhaps?\" Winston ventured, aware of the calculated cryptic response.\n \n\n Penelope nodded, emphasis paving way to dread as Winston clarified,\n \"A crime that might... involve poisonous gas?\"\n \n\n Penelope’s fear manifested through her expressive features, propelling Winston to probe her further.\n \n\n \"It appears that Tessa had found letters linking you with past offenses...\" Winston began, only to be interrupted mid-sentence as Penelope braced herself.\n \n\n \"She did confront me, yes. Said something about me having been involved in past crimes. I did not...,\" her voice quivered, trailing off.\n \n\n \"You were seen arriving at Tessa's place that evening. But, oddly enough, nobody actually saw you leave...why do you suppose that is?\" Winston asked, deliberately amplifying the tension.\n \n\n \"Well, I... I was there to read her tarot that evening. I was alone in the kitchen while she was getting us some wine.\"\n \n\n \"But still, no sightings of your departure?\" Winston pressed.\n \n\n \"I... It...,\" Penelope faltered, but Winston refrained from asking further questions. He pocketed his notepad before making his way to the exit. As he left, he caught a glimpse of a chemistry degree hanging by the door - a degree that censured the name Penelope on its title. This discovery validated the suspicions about her in-depth knowledge of chemistry and alchemy - fields possibly employed for darker purposes.\n \n\n Winston squinted over the rim of his empty coffee mug at the nervous officer seated across the table. Melody cleared her throat, uneasy under the direct and critical gaze of the grizzled detective.\n \n\n \"So, Tessa's bakery... it was right smack in the middle of the expansion you proposed for your patrol zone, wasn't it?\" Winston asked, pausing to lean back on his chair, \"To my understanding, all other businesses in the area were highly cooperative. Was Tessa the only one resisting the expansion?\"\n \n\n \"Yes, sir.\" Melody said, her tone defensive. \"And every time I tried to talk to Tessa about it, maybe cut a deal, she wasn't having it. She was the only stubborn holdout against my proposals.\"\n \n\n \"I see.\" Winston scribbled a note on the paper in front of him, shielding it from view with a well-practiced arm block. \"Dealing with hazardous materials... that's part of police training, right? You've taken classes for that?\"\n \n\n Melody nodded. \"Sure, we all have. Necessary for emergency situations.\"\n \n\n \"Hmm. Have access to any of these dangerous substances?\" Winston asked, his eyes flickering up from his notes.\n \n\n Melody puzzled over this question for a moment. \"Well, yes. We have a secure storage for them. For certain operations.\"\n \n\n \"Like poisonous gas,\" Winston said, as if discussing the weather. Melody hesitated and then nodded, a flicker of apprehension crossing her face.\n \n\n \"Have any hobbies, Officer Melody?\"\n \n\n \"Um, reading, I suppose,\" she said, stiffening. \"I always have a bunch of new thrillers and murder mysteries borrowed from the library.\"\n \n\n \"What do you read?\"\n \n\n Melody raised her eyebrows, almost startled. \"Different stuff. But mostly thrillers, murder mysteries...\"\n \n\n \"Funny. Your co-workers mention seeing you engrossed in them quite often during breaks. Read them at your house too, for a book club, don't you?\" Winston pursued, ignoring the slight flush that spread across Melody's cheeks. \n \n\n \"Well...yes,\" Melody admitted, nearly blushing. \"We frequently meet up at my place to discuss the latest thriller.\"\n \n\n Downing the last dregs of his cold coffee, Winston pushed away from the table and stood to leave. \"Well, Officer Melody,\" he said, pulling on his weathered leather jacket. \"It seems there is much I need to ponder. We'll take it from here. Thank you for your time.\"\n \n\n He left Melody sitting in the cold interrogation room, her mind whirling.",

The clues were frustratingly scarce - no fingerprints, no forced entry, and the murder weapon, poisonous gas, a lethal specter leaving no traceable footprints. He put on a pair of gloves and sifted through the crime scene photos, his eyes resting on one of Penelope, Tessa's tarot card reader.\n \n\n Penelope, decked in an extravagant costume, stood out against the throng of guests at the gala. The disguise concealed much of her face, but it was an ineffective veil for her true intent. Winston wasn't looking for her in person; he was instead hoping to unravel the layers of her past.\n \n\n He turned his attention to the stream of reports from the other officer. No one remembered conversing with Penelope throughout the evening. Winston rubbed his stubbled chin.\n \n\n \"Got a statement saying Penelope was alone in Tessa's kitchen during her tarot reading session,\" the officer informed Winston. \"And she was seen arriving prior to the murder. And just before the time of the murder, multiple witnesses claim they saw Penelope hurriedly leaving Tessa's kitchen, disappearing from the view. However, no one reported seeing Penelope leave Tessa's place before Tessa's lifeless body was found\".\n \n\n Winston felt a chill in his spine as he imagined the confrontation that could have happened in the intimacy of Tessa's kitchen. The letters, the crucial evidence in Tessa's hands, holding the ink stains of Penelope's past crimes, would likely have hit Penelope like a freight train. And, according to Winston's informants, Tessa had indeed confronted Penelope about these crimes, engendering a strong reaction in Penelope; her fear was palpable, even to those who had reported the confrontation.\n \n\n \"Well now, Penelope. What have you been up to?\" Winston murmured to himself as he placed the stack of documents on his desk.\n \n\n There was something about Tessa's knowledge about Penelope's past, about Tessa's confrontation, about Penelope's fearful reaction. Plenty of smoke, Winston thought, but where's the fire?\n \n\n Everything linked together so subtly. He sighed, running his hands through his hair. Despite the baffling circumstances of the case, Winston knew one fact: he had a pressing investigation ahead of him. It was going to be a long night.\n \n\n Winston sat hunched over a map pinned to a wall, hand gripping a steaming cup of coffee. Spread out on a desk below, a sprawl of case files surrounded an opened notebook filled with scrawls and coffee rings. As a former officer himself, he knew that standard police training involved the handling of dangerous substances. The ring of a phone broke his contemplation and as he picked it up, the familiar voice of the dispatcher told him he was needed at the scene of a potential gas leak. The location sounded familiar. He sighed, downed the last of his coffee, and grabbed his coat.\n \n\n Arriving at the house, he was surprised to see Officer Melody securing the scene. She was a friendly face, someone he'd dealt with on many occasions. Her patrol fell largely within the residential district, and Tessa's home was one of the many stops on her beat.\n \n\n The moment he stepped out of his car, the pungent smell of gas filled his nostrils. He quickly made his way to Melody. \"Gas leak, huh?\" Winston asked, looking at the small, attractive home. Melody turned to him, nodding slowly, \"Came in as that, yes,\" she replied, her voice betraying a hint of concern. \"It's Tessa's place...\"\n \n\n Melody led him to the kitchen, where the gas leak had occurred. The cold, lifeless body of Tessa lay sprawled on the floor. As part of her duties, Melody filled out the police report, marking down vital details.\n \n\n During their conversation, Winston found out that Melody had been on active duty on the day of the murder, her name clearly listed on the roster. It wasn't unexpected. Melody put in more hours than most other officers, often going above and beyond her duties.\n \n\n As Melody was talking, Winston's gaze was drawn to a certificate hung on the wall of her patrol car denoting her authorized clearance to use poisonous gas in the case of an emergency. The police department did keep a small supply for situations that demanded it, and Melody, like all other officers, had been trained in the handling of such dangerous substances.\n \n\n Winston learned a shocking fact as he delved into the case. Tessa's bakery, which sat right in the middle of Melody's patrol zone, was the only establishment that was hindering the territorial expansion Melody had been working towards. The bakery had been a bone of contention for Melody, who had made several offers to Tessa trying to negotiate some form of compromise. But Tessa, it seems, had flatly refused every single one.\n \n\n As Winston departed the crime scene, he noted that Melody had taken additional courses on handling hazardous materials. But she had always considered herself to be a vigilant public servant. A protector. And as he looked back at Tessa's house, surrounded by yellow tape, he made a note to dig deeper. To understand how the life of a simple baker could intersect so tragically with that of a devoted police officer, and a gas leak that became deadly.",

        "context": "When Joel's life was abruptly ended by a nunchaku at the local bowling alley, it is up to Detective Winston to interrogate the prime suspects: Rosemary and Mia, a proudly non‑binary person,, in this chilling game of strike or spare.\n \n\n Kneading the stub of his cigarette into the worn-out ashtray, Winston's gaze flitted between the photographs in front of him. A bowling alley, deserted, save for a solitary figure slumped over in the congealing slick of his own blood – the scene drenched in a chilling morbidity. \n \n\n His suspect was Mia, a waitress at the bowling alley. The late shift was her domain; her eyes, always heavy-lidded with fatigue, had fallen on a familiar figure, Joel, numbingly often. The man had his peculiar habits, including late-night bowling. Mia had a keen knowledge of that; it wasn’t easy to overlook when they regularly crossed paths during her shifts, Joel’s ball thundering and skidding down the shiny lanes.\n \n\n Fiddling with a small, old key on his desk, Winston’s thought went back to his first meeting with Mia. He had found the key while cleaning her table after an interview and asked her about it. Almost flippantly, she mentioned it was for a private mausoleum in the nearby cemetery. The location was within walking distance from her workplace, an old cemetery cloaked in a gloom that seemed centuries old. The eerie part was her odd ritual; post her shift, her coworkers attested to seeing her trudge towards the graveyard regularly, a private pilgrimage in the dead of night.\n \n\n Winston vividly remembered his surprise when he had found nunchaku, a pair of them, while searching Mia's home. The night visits to the cemetery coupled with the ominous presence of the martial arts weapon was undoubtedly unsettling. Unraveling further, he found out Mia had been practicing and honing her skills with the nunchaku at home, late into the night. For years, she had been devoted to martial arts, with a particular emphasis on the nunchaku, the significance of which crept up on him like a poisonous vine. Her gym was known for teaching the use of this weapon.\n \n\n \"I suspect you're quite adept at swinging these,\" Winston had said to Mia, gesturing towards the nunchaku that lay on the table between them when he'd confronted her about it later. \n \n\n Mia had smiled enigmatically, her eyes twinkling with the lethality of secrets untold. \"Keep your eyes open, detective,\" she had replied, her voice a chilling sotto voce lingering between them, hang enough in the suffocating silence.\n \n\n His thoughts whirling, Winston stubbed out the last of his cigarette. The available evidence was yet to form a coherent story, but Mia was conspicuous. He had ventured into labyrinthian investigations before, but the mystery of Joel's murder felt like uncharted territory. Winston felt a shiver creep into his spine as he got ready for round two with Mia.\n \n\n Winston stepped into the dimly lit bowling alley, prowling between lanes like a panther on the hunt. An unusual place to be hammered to death, he thought, especially during the graveyard shift, but a good detective never questioned the chosen venues or the hour of the city's grim reaper. Winston surveyed the empty building, the only sound being that of his own boots echoing off the polished hardwood.\n \n\n The bartender, one Rosemary – if her nameplate could be trusted – was scrubbing down a countertop at the far corner of the bar. Winston walked over, took a seat on one of the bar stools and introduced himself. \n \n\n \"I hear you were working here the night Joel was killed,\" he mentioned, as he watched her movements. \n \n\n Rosemary looked up, her face impassive, \"Yes, that's true. It was my usual midnight shift, and Joel got murdered after we had closed down for the night. Wasn't much else to do.\"\n \n\n \"You seem to have keys to this place,\" Winston noticed, spotting a set of keys on the counter. \n \n\n \"Yes, I do, for closing hours,\" she replied, sliding the keys back into her jeans pocket.\n \n\n He continued his questions, \"I understand you practice martial arts, Rosemary?\"\n \n\n For the first time, Rosemary stopped her cleaning and smiled, \"Yes, that's right. In fact, I work out regularly at a martial arts gym. Nunchaku workshops are my favorite,\" she added, her eyes twinkling with something akin to pride.\n \n\n Winston nodded, imparting no judgement on her preferred pastime. \n \n\n Suddenly, a glint at the corner of the room caught his attention. A collection of weaponry displayed on a wall. Upon closer look, he recognized various martial arts weapons, including a pair of nunchaku.\n \n\n “My father was a big fan of martial arts. He left me his collection,\" explained Rosemary, noticing his interest. \"In fact, the nunchaku you see hanging on the wall is part of my personal collection.\"\n \n\n As Winston stood up to leave, he turned to Rosemary, \"Did you know Joel well?\"\n \n\n She hesitated for a moment, her eyes downcast, \"Joel... he was a good friend. He always wanted to help. And he was the one person who could save me from this terrible debt I'm wrestling with. But to my despair, he... he said no when I asked him for a loan.\"\n \n\n As Winston exited the empty bowling alley, he couldn't help but mull over Rosemary's last words. This was shaping up to be a long investigation, a fact he was all too aware of as he walked into the piercing chill of the night cityscape.",

        "context": "When Joel's life was abruptly ended by a nunchaku at the local bowling alley, it is up to Detective Winston to interrogate the prime suspects: Rosemary, who identifies as non‑binary, and Mia, in this chilling game of strike or spare.\n \n\n The bowling alley bore a sense of life even after closing time. The late-night echoes of thundering strikes and trash talks were now drowned by sirens and muffled conversations over secured radios. Winston paid no attention to the cacophony around him, his focus narrowed onto the sole thing out of place in a bowling alley—a pair of nunchaku.\n \n\n He walked over to Mia, the waitress, a name and face familiar to many, a respected public figure among the regulars at the bowling alley.\n \n\n \"Late-night shifts, it looks like,\" Winston began conversationally, \"You often see a lot of the regulars, I suppose?”\n \n\n Mia let out a sigh, suppressing a weary smile, \"Bowling is a religion for some, detective. Joel, for instance, he's nearly always here late-night, been observing him for quite some time.\"\n \n\n \"Like Joel?\" Winston probed further.\n \n\n \"Like Joel,” She echoed.\n \n\n As a public figure, Mia was often under scrutiny. Despite this, she had always been closely seen with Joel at unusual hours, both witnessed in hushed conversations when Mia was off duty—nothing scandalous, just unusual as per the grapevine.\n \n\n \"Mia, may I ask about your recreational activities?\" Winston maneuvered the topic.\n \n\n \"I've been training in martial arts for quite some time, Detective,\" Mia responded without missing a beat. \"Nunchaku as well, it's one of the various arts they teach at my gym and I just happened to fall in love with it.\"\n \n\n \"Nunchaku?\" Winston asked, to which, Mia merely nodded. It was known among the locals that Mia often spent long, late nights practicing with her pair of Nunchaku at home, an acquired hobby, a passion honed in the confines of the martial arts gym she frequented.\n \n\n Joel was often at the bowling alley during Mia's night shifts. It wasn't unusual, but there was something that always seemed a little off about it. Mia, the waitress at the bowling alley, knew about Joel's regular late-night bowling habits. Perhaps due to this, Joel often ended up bowling late on the nights Mia was working.\n \n\n She then recalled one unnerving evening—Joel explicitly threatening to unveil a potent political scandal that would surely taint her reputation if ever it reached the public. Shivers ran down her spine with the cold memory.\n \n\n As Winston walked away, he took one last glance back at Mia. Her eyes looked like they were both emancipating and imprisoning secrets she would rather stay hidden. Winston knew his work was far from over.\n \n\n Winston scanned the crime scene photos of the late-night bowling alley murder for the umpteenth time, swiveling lazily in his office chair. Joel, the victim, had unfortunately found his end using a pair of nunchaku, a brutal, yet strangely eccentric way for a life to be taken - and that too after official business hours, an unusual occasion at the alley.\n \n\n He downed the last of his coffee and grabbed his jacket, ready to conduct another careful suspect interview. He set out to find Rosemary, who had been working her overtime shift at the bowling alley when the murder occurred eerily during the late after hours.\n \n\n Stepping into the buzzing local bar, candlelight bounced off the myriad of glass bottles lining the walls, all reachable only by ladders that the bartenders navigated with incredible balance. Rosemary, carting herself from the fridge to the counter, looked up at Winston as he approached. She looked perfectly graceful, a stark contrast to her claim of frequently bumping into things.\n \n\n \"Rosemary, I presume,\" Winston opened, his gaze lingering on her form, conspicuously clad in a long-sleeved shirt despite the warm ambient temperature.\n \n\n \"That's correct,\" she responded, her voice warm yet curt. As she reached for a bottle on a high shelf, she winced slightly. \"Got a stiff shoulder. Those martial arts gym workouts can be taxing sometimes,\" she casually mentioned, subtly revealing her regular gym sessions.\n \n\n \"I'm aware of your regular participation in nunchaku workshops at the local martial arts gym,\" Winston commented, given her previous statement. Rosemary chuckled, responding with a flex of her arms, clearly hinting at her muscular strength. Her attention moved toward a set of keys she was fiddle around with.\n \n\n \"Bowling alley keys. Part of the job,\" she explained before he had to ask, and then another conversation to make small talk deftly guided by the detective.\n \n\n \"Some nice nunchaku you have up there,\" Winston finally stated, nodding toward a martial-arts weapons display above the bar.\n \n\n \"Inherited,\" she said with a slight nod. \"Practiced a bit. It's art you know.\"\n \n\n Before Winston could subtly inquire about her bowling alley shift on the night of the murder, another customer called her away. Yet, his observations continued as she navigated through the bar serving drinks - she moved flawlessly, despite her prior claim of clumsiness.\n \n\n Leaving the bar, Winston mulled over the information he gathered - Rosemary had worked at the bowling alley on the fateful night, she had keys to the place as part of her job, had trained in using and collected nunchaku, was a regular at the martial arts gym, and had inherited a collection of martial-arts weapons. All these shaped another puzzle for him to solve.\n \n\n Winston was no stranger to dealing with loose ends and carefully sifting fact from fiction. But even with the facts he gathered from Rosemary's interview, Joel's perpetrator was still elusive. The only certainty was the haunting image of the murder weapon, nunchaku, which were a significant part of Rosemary's life. The case was far from closed.",

Richard’s face was absorbed in the glow of the paused true crime documentary, his eyes reflecting morbid fascination and intense concentration. \n \n\n \"Richard?\" Winston called out, cutting through the gloomy silence, drawing the man's attention away from the screen. The detective's brows furrowed curiously at the patterned sweat marks on Richard's shirt, as well as abrasions on his hand.\n \n\n \"Just finishing up your work-out?\" Winston asked, gesturing towards the sweat-soaked shirt.\n \n\n \"Ah, yes, detective,\" Richard confessed, catching on to his implication. \"Those marks? I was practicing my nunchaku techniques in the martial arts class before you arrived. Quite challenging to get the swings right. Purchased these nunchaku from a sports equipment store last month. It's part of my martial arts training.\"\n \n\n \"Martial arts? I wouldn’t have expected that from a waiter,\" Winston said, conversing readily.\n \n\n \"The mosque I work at, it's next to this martial arts institution. We do nunchaku training as part of our drills. Isabella, tragically enough, was also a part of the same class, and I just like keeping myself engaged.\" Richard shrugged.\n \n\n \"Speaking of keeping engaged,\" Winston glanced towards the paused documentary on the laptop, \"Looks like you've got quite the fascination with true crime, huh?\"\n \n\n \"I listen, rewind, analyze, and repeat...\" Richard said, reaching towards his notebook that lay next to the computer, brimming with his own investigation strategies, \"I write down interesting details. I find it... intriguing, to say the least.\"\n \n\n \"Ah, a keen observer. Useful in a job like yours,\" Winston said, nodding in understanding. \n \n\n \"I rarely interact with anyone outside my working hours, detective,\" Richard asserted with a hint of defensiveness, immediately finishing off his sentence. \"The day the tragedy happened, I was at the martial arts class first, then I went to the mosque...but I was alone.\"\n \n\n The glint in Richard's eyes gave away nothing, but Winston saw the flicker of insight deepen. With a curt nod, he stood up, leaving Richard in the expanse of his own silence. As the day drew to a close, Winston had to acknowledge one thing - Richard was an enigma, much like the case he found himself entangled in.\n \n\n Detective Winston was having one hell of a day, nursing a mug of coffee that had long since turned cold with the reports strewn about on his desk. \n \n\n A crime was reported, suspicious activity by a local hairdresser named Malaysia, notorious for her volatile behavior. Some customers claimed to see her practicing martial arts in the salon in her free time. Malaysia was also often seen at home practicing her martial arts moves and had even purchased a pair of nunchaku. She had a fondness for martial arts revered from her high school days when she attended martial arts classes. She was a fervent admirer of martial arts movies, and supposedly sought to bring some of those electrifying martial arts stunts to life.\n \n\n On the day of the crime, Malaysia was not on her workplace's schedule. This was a detail that leaped out of her shoddy alibi. Noting her erratic behavior, a lady named Isabella had found it suspicious. She even reported her concerns to the authorities.\n \n\n With this lead in hand, Winston headed towards Malaysia’s place. A variety of martial arts equipment arranged delicately welcomed him, including the purchased pair of nunchaku, the kind usually bought by hardcore martial arts supporters and fighters. \n \n\n A gentle voice pulled him back from his thoughts when Malaysia invited him inside. It turned out that martial arts was more than just a hobby for her; it was embedded in every crevice of her life. Interestingly, she mentioned visiting a nearby mosque, which she had loved since childhood. She had always frequented the mosque, participating in various volunteering activities and contributing to its well-being.\n \n\n In the middle of their conversation, a couple of police officers joining them, interrogating Malaysia about a theft. The stolen items were eventually found in her possession, which made Winston arch an eyebrow, but he said nothing.\n \n\n The same mosque was the place where Isabella, the one who had noticed and reported Malaysia’s suspicious behavior, was murdered. \n \n\n Winston stood silently, observing Malaysia during the conversation, before excusing himself from her apartment and returning to his office. His coffee was still tepid and the files hadn’t moved, but somehow, he saw the case from a different perspective.",

        "context": "In the mystifying quiet of a mosque, Isabella was found lifeless, a nunchaku the lone cause, casting Detective Winston into a whirlwind investigation with suspects Malaysia, a non‑binary individual, and Richard at the heart of the mystery.\n \n\n Detective Winston was in his office, pouring over the facts of the Isabella case. Isabella was a young woman murdered in a mosque with a pair of nunchaku. Her case was sent to him because not only was the method of murder unusual but the strange behavior she'd reported was disconcerting.\n \n\n Isabella had reported suspicious activity to the authorities, claiming an acquaintance named Malaysia was acting out of sorts. The name Malaysia was ringing alarm bells for Winston. The police had already questioned her regarding a theft, and now, with Isabella's murder, he felt the need to dig deeper.\n \n\n Winston knocked on the door of Malaysia's small home, case files in hand. She was a hairdresser by trade, known to be a fan of martial arts movies, placing Bruce Lee as her idol, and had a knack for practicing martial arts moves at home. She had purchased nunchaku recently.  \n \n\n Winston was greeted with a jovial smile when he arrived, and once pleasantries were exchanged, his questions began.\n \n\n “I noticed a uniform in that bag by your door,” Winston nodded towards the corner of the room. “You do martial arts?”\n \n\n “Sure do,” she replied cheerfully. “Nothing like a little kick and a punch after a long day, especially after watching a good martial arts movie.”\n \n\n Winston watched her closely but Malaysia seemed to only speak the truth. “Did you ever take martial arts classes?”\n \n\n Malaysia chuckled, “Does high school count? I took it for a few years then. I was a Bruce Lee in the making.”\n \n\n He took a deep breath and continued, “What about your family, Malaysia?” Winston asked, trying to dig into her background. \n \n\n Malaysia shrugged. “Well detective, it's as erratic as the weather these days. Speaking of which, I do believe we are in for some rain later today.\"\n \n\n Feeling slightly exasperated, Winston decided to prod a bit more. \"And your love life, Malaysia?\" he asked. \n \n\n \"Oh, it's like 'Gone With The Wind',\" she replied, winking at him. \"An epic which suddenly disappears. Like any good movie, wouldn't you agree, Winston?\"\n \n\n He decided to tread lightly. “You ever practice with nunchaku?”\n \n\n Malaysia’s gaze never wavered, “Oh, sure. Bought a pair recently. They came in handy when Isabella tried taking my TV. Those are some nice detective notes you've got there around a theft, happened a few days ago, isn't it? The police already asked me about those.\"\n \n\n As Winston left Malaysia's home, he was left with a feeling of uncertainty. There was much to unravel about this peculiar woman, and he still couldn’t shake off the uneasy feeling of her jovial exterior that hid a string of suspicious facts. Isabella might have been gone, but Winston was determined to uncover the truth for her sake.\n \n\n Winston eyed the austere environment of the mosque, draped in silence and shadows. As he looked at this deserted place of worship, he thought of the vibrant Isabella, now lying lifeless.\n \n\n Remembering his conversations with Isabella's friends, he couldn't help but recall them saying how determined she was to escape Richard for good. Isabella's friends had mentioned her to him - how she told them she intended to finally break free from Richard permanently.\n \n\n He decided to talk to Richard, a local waiter who had been working at the mosque during those deserted, deadly hours that took Isabella's life.\n \n\n Richard stood by the main entryway, enduring the barrage of lights and unfamiliar faces. Winston recognized him from his not-so-distant encounter with the law - a case of domestic violence involving him and Isabella.\n \n\n \"Evening, Richard,\" Winston started, extending a friendly hand. \"Been working here long?\"\n \n\n \"Few months, sir,\" Richard replied, his voice steady. \"Only serve the occasional visitor during the day. I was alone yesterday. No one else was here.\"\n \n\n Winston nodded, making a mental note of Richard's presence at the mosque during the time of Isabella's murder. \"I've seen you before. A martial arts class, wasn't it?\"\n \n\n Richard's gaze flickered with surprise before he recovered, his professional mask back in place. \"Yes. Same class as Isabella.\"\n \n\n Winston recalled seeing Richard in that martial arts class, practicing nunchaku - the same weapon that had ended Isabella's life. And not too long ago, he had seen him at the local sports equipment store, purchasing a set of nunchaku.\n \n\n \"Quite a skill you've got there,\" Winston continued, keeping his voice casual. \"Heard you and Isabella trained together.\"\n \n\n Richard sighed, his gaze flicked towards the mosque's silent dome. \"Yeah, we both were there. Couldn't seem to get away from each other.”\n \n\n \"I'm sure,\" Winston agreed. Neighbors had reported frequently hearing the couple arguing, their quarrels escalating in intensity. \"How was Isabella doing?\"\n \n\n Richard paused, his brow furrowed. \"She... She was... planning to leave.\"\n \n\n \"Leave?\" Winston asked, knowing that Isabella had finally decided to break free from Richard permanently. She had even confided in her friends about her escape plans and purchased a ticket for a one-way trip out of the country.\n \n\n \"Yes...\" Richard's voice was barely audible. \"Leave me. Leave everything.\"\n \n\n With that, Winston thanked Richard and turned to leave, his thoughts spinning around the tragic tale of Isabella, her life brutally ended in this quiet mosque she had formerly sought peace.",

As he smoothed the slightly wrinkled photograph of the victim, he couldn't help but acknowledge the gravity of the murder that had taken place out in the desolate stretches of the desert.\n \n\n \"Heard you requested a flamethrower for your workshop,\" Winston started as he visited Paige, Renee's mentee, at her special effects shop. She let him in, even showing him around her tools which included a newly acquired flamethrower for realistic movie effects, which she was seen handling just a few days ago. Winston remembered walking by the open garage door and catching a glimpse of Paige playing with the flamethrower, her face what he could only describe as an excited child with a new toy.\n \n\n \"May I ask if you were the last person seen with Renee?\" Winston asked.\n \n\n \"Yes, detective, I was,\" Paige answered. \n \n\n Seeing no reason to evade the question, Paige mentioned how she repeatedly advised Renee to retire from her line of work. \"She was always stubborn and distant, especially with me,\" Paige shared, an indication of Renee trying to distance herself. \"She was in her sixties but she refused to slow down, causing me to feel constant frustration and would frequently make me lash out,\" Paige confided. \"It always upset me,\" she further admitted her thoughts, letting Winston understand the volatile mentor-protege relationship dynamics.\n \n\n Winston nodded, storing this important information about the dynamics between Paige and Renee. \"I have found out from the delivery company that a flamethrower was delivered to this workshop recently. Was it yours? The one you ordered?\"\n \n\n \"Yes, that's correct,\" Paige replied, her face unchanging. \"You see, I work in special effects. I deal with all sorts of contraptions, including flamethrowers. They're not as deadly as they seem, you know? Only in the wrong hands...\"\n \n\n It seemed like Paige was positioning herself just within the edge of suspicion, but Winston kept his thoughts to himself, a stoic expression fixed on his face. He then asked about Paige's closeness with the desert, a quick detour from her workshop. \n \n\n \"Oh, it's easily accessible. I often take a walk to clear my head,\" she replied, \"And Renee knew about my frequent trips there, that's why it wasn't unusual for her when I told her I wanted to show her something in the desert.\"\n \n\n Paige's love for Renee was well known and she wasn't ready to hide it when asked. \"She was special to me, you know. But she never showed up to see what I planned. The next thing I know, she was dead.\"\n \n\n Feeling he had enough for the moment, Winston decided to end the conversation. Among the many things he had gathered, a fact that stuck to him was the requested flamethrower, seen in Paige's possession a few days ago, was also the murder weapon used in this case, delivered right at Paige's workshop.\n \n\n As Winston was leaving, Paige's gaze followed him. She had a look of a woman caught in a tale of true obsession.\n \n\n Winston parked his car in front of the coffee shop. The afternoon was calm and dry, typical of a day in the desert.\n  \"Marianne.\" He called to the barista working behind the counter.\n \n\n \"Yes sir, what can I get you?\" She looked up with a plastered service smile that Winston had seen more often than he'd like to admit.\n \n\n \"Coffee, black,\" he added.\n \n\n Marianne was usually a woman of few words. It was already known in the café that Marianne, although a people person during work hours, preferred solitude outside of work. She was somewhat enigmatic, leaving work as soon as her shift ended without any explanation about her after-work plans. It was a habit she diligently stuck to, against curious coworkers who often loiter around longer.\n \n\n \"Winston, aren't you?\" She handed over the coffee, her facial expression gave away nothing. She had a breed of indifference that he found puzzling.\n \n\n \"Yeah, you remember.\" He toasted his coffee cup, looking at the foam art on its surface.\n \n\n Rumor has it that Marianne had been spotted frequenting a local pawn shop on her way from work. Curiously, after one of her visits, a flamethrower was found missing from the shop - the owner had confirmed it himself, ruffling through the shop inventory in disbelief. A particular stock draw from the shop should technically be tagged a coincidence and yet, here he was.\n \n\n \"So, how'd you end up here?\" Winston decided to put out some line, in search of a bite.\n \n\n \"Needed a job, this did me good,\" she stated curtly, keeping it decidedly professional.\n \n\n \"I hear you gotta get fire safety certification to keep the espresso machines running and avoid mishaps. That true?\" He ventured further.\n \n\n \"Yeah, mandatory stuff.\" She added, the impenetrable exterior still intact.\n \n\n \"That's neat, handy skills I reckon.\" He sipped his coffee, testing the waters.\n \n\n That's when he remembered the rumors – Marianne had been arrested for a theft charge. Worse yet, she was found guilty and now, a court date next week awaiting sentencing. It all seemed to tie back to an unfortunate event in the desert involving an individual named Renee, who had testified against Marianne in court. Not just a common run-in-the-mill victim, but linked to Marianne with a web of unknown connections.\n \n\n \"What time do you get off work?\" He asked, catching her off guard.\n \n\n \"I...like to go straight home.\" She fumbled her words. The confession about her arrest seemed to take the wind out of her sails.\n \n\n After a small chat about the dry weather, Winston mentioned he was headed to the pawn shop down the road, on the trail of the missing flamethrower, leaving a hint of a departing farewell. She visibly winced, although she recovered quickly, her unusually bright eyes watched him with a hint of alarm as he walked out.\n \n\n She turned to the wall clock as soon as the shop door jingled shut - the end of her shift almost due. Winston absorbed this behavior, letting his gaze linger for one more moment before setting off.",

Renee, the mentor of his current subject of interest in this case named Paige, was loved by many. She had always guided those under her with kindness but it seems even kindness isn’t enough to buy one safety.\n \n\n Finding more peace in solitude, he decided to pay a visit to the same desert where Renee's charred remains were found.

Along with that, he also took note of another change in her appearance on Monday - the color of her contacts. She was seen wearing blue contacts, unlike the green ones she was wearing during the Wednesday meeting.\n \n\n Paige was a special effects expert, especially adept at managing flamethrowers, probably a reason for the flamethrower request at her special effects workshop. Something Paige had mentioned stood out to him, her desire to demonstrate something in the desert to Renee, her mentor.\n \n\n Upon returning from the desert to Paige's workshop, the tech area was filled with different props and gadgets, all related to special effects. Among all, the flamethrower that she had requested stood out, it was identical to the one she was spotted with a few days back.\n \n\n Tired and deep in thought, he took some quiet time to contemplate his findings, particularly about the chilling fact - Paige was the last person to be seen with Renee before she went missing.\n \n\n As always, Winston's face remained mask-like, revealing nothing as he continued to probe and understand, focusing solely on gathering the facts of the chaotic mosaic before him. He knew there were many pieces yet to be put into place before the picture could begin to make sense.\n \n\n Winston gazed over the desert horizon, letting his eyes rest on what felt like an infinite sea of sand. It was here where Renee's body was found, thoroughly torched, origins of which was thought to be a flamethrower. \n \n\n He headed away from the scene, his mind whirling with questions and concerns, to conduct his next interview. His destination was a well-known cafe at the edge of town.\n \n\n Marianne, the barista, had a strange calmness about her, despite being awaiting her punishment next week after being found guilty of theft. She didn’t flinch when she saw officer Winston approach - instead, she graciously offered him a cup of Joe. Around her, there was no evidence of anyone else's presence.\n \n\n “Hello Marianne,” Winston made idle chat, “It must get pretty hot back here in the summers.”\n \n\n “Surely does, but we’ve got it under control,” Marianne replied, sipping her coffee, “We've all done a thorough fire safety course.”\n \n\n Winston nodded and decided to change the subject. “I heard you've recently visited the pawn shop and there seems to be a flamethrower missing after your visit”\n \n\n “Sometimes, yeah, I shop there. Good old stuff comes cheap,” Marianne replied casually, not giving away any signs of panic.\n \n\n “Any recent purchases?” Winston asked carefully.\n \n\n “Can't recall,” Marianne quickly replied, her tone betraying nothing.\n \n\n Winston shifted gears again, “Sounds like you have some travel plans? A solo road trip...”\n \n\n Marianne shrugged, “I keep hearing about this desert route, figured I might give it a shot.”\n \n\n “I hope you’ll travel safely. Deserts can be dangerous, y’know,” Winston remarked. \"We found a woman's body there terribly torched...\" \n \n\n Before he could finish, Marianne held up a hand, “Renee, wasn’t it? She testified against me in court if you weren’t aware. Sad news for sure.”\n \n\n “Indeed,” Winston nodded solemnly, “Indeed it is.” He finished his coffee and stood up to leave. “Good luck with your punishment next week, Marianne. See you around.”\n \n\n With that, Winston left the coffee shop, ending the first round of this seemingly endless cycle of questions.",

        "context": "In the lavish surroundings of a luxury restaurant, Renee's life was cut brutally short by barbed wire; now, Detective Winston must unravel the tangled suspects, Claire and Isla, who identifies as non‑binary,.\n \n\n Winston found himself in the bustling metropolis, drawn by a callous crime that had surprised even him. The victim, Renee, was a rising star in the music scene and her death had shocked everyone. At the top of the suspect list was Isla, a devoted groupie of what seemed to be the rival band.\n \n\n As he stepped onto the stage of what had previously been the sight of the unfortunate event, Winston remembered what led him here. A music gala where Renee’s band had triumphed and Isla’s favorite, struggled. \n \n\n Winston recalled how Isla had not taken this well. She was vocal, very vocal about her displeasure. The public declaration of her resentment - just another peculiar thing about the woman. This incident especially struck Winston because in all his discussions with Isla's friends, none of them ever mentioned meeting the band members, providing more peculiarity to Isla's obsession. \n \n\n \"Meeting Isla for the second time, is it?\" the stage manager asked. Winston nodded. Questions about her past had prompted more questions than answers. Publically, Isla was known to be biased against Renee's culture. Subject to discrimination lawsuits filed by those she regularly chose to isolate.\n \n\n Getting into the intricacies of Isla’s life had been more complicated than catching a spider in a hurricane. She never gave a straight answer about her activities in her free time, a fact that had earned her some scrutiny.\n \n\n \"Constant red flags with this one,\" Winston mused to himself. Isla had a knack for privacy. She left the room whenever she received a phone call. Never invited her friends to the band's concerts. Always arrived alone.\n \n\n On the other hand, she was known for learning survival skills from online sources. Owned a private collection of survival tools at her home, where the infamous barbed wire was reportedly found. The same barbed wire, as was later confirmed, used against an intruder some months back. \n \n\n As he was leaving, Winston got a call from a local store clerk who claimed to have sold a roll of barbed wire to Isla the day before the horrific event.\n \n\n “All evidence points to her,” the store clerk had said.\n \n\n “Nothing is for certain yet,” Winston had firmly replied. He knew the importance to avoid jumping to conclusions, let the evidence guide the investigation. With those thoughts, he tucked away his notepad and decided to keep a closer eye on Isla. The ball game was just starting to get interesting. His aim was to do whatever it took to ensure that this case reached a fair pitch.\n \n\n As Winston cruised up to the crime scene, he took a moment to appreciate the opulence of the luxury restaurant. A grand piano player in the lobby, exotic flora, and a gourmet menu, it had it all. A lady, Claire as he would come to know, was sitting outside the restaurant in her car. She was shaking, clearly upset, her eyes teary and red.\n \n\n \"I suppose you're Claire,\" Winston guessed, peering through the passenger side window. \n \n\n \"Yes,\" she sniffed. \"I work here and in that place...\" she pointed feebly towards the towering construction site in the near distance. \"Merely a secretary during the day, and a skilled gardener during my time off, never a scratch from the barbed wire that fences my garden.\" \n \n\n \"Seems like you've got your hands full,\" Winston remarked, eyeing the construction site. \"That's a lot of barbed wire over there.\"\n \n\n \"Yes...\" she said, \"but I'm used to handling barbed wire. We've got some fencing my garden at home too.\"\n \n\n \"I heard you have keys to all sections of this restaurant,\" asked Winston.\n \n\n \"Yes, I do,\" Claire nodded, \"the management insists we keep everything secure, and since I work here, they trust me with the keys.\"\n \n\n \"Why were you at the restaurant today, Claire?\" He asked, looking closely at the woman in front of him. \n \n\n \"I usually work at the restaurant during lunch hours,\" Claire responded. \"Today was no different.\"\n \n\n \"Strange circumstances today, though...\" Winston said. \"Did you know Renee was planning to file a report about some huge financial disparities at the restaurant?\"\n \n\n Claire squirmed a bit at his words. \"I heard something about it,\" she mumbled. \"But it's only whispers. Renee believed there was a thief... that there was someone embezzling money from the restaurant.\"\n \n\n \"And she thought that person was you, didn't she?\" Winston questioned.\n \n\n Claire's face turned whiter than it already was. \"I...I...\" was all she could choke out. \n \n\n \"She had evidence, Claire,\" Winston continued, taking the report out of his bag. \"She'd traced back all the missing funds to your bank account.\" He waived it in the air between them. \"She was about to expose you, wasn't she?\"\n \n\n \"Yes,\" she whispered, almost inaudibly, confirming her role in the embezzlement.\n \n\n Winston left Claire in her car, lost in her thoughts. Puzzles to piece together, he thought to himself, getting in his car and heading back to the precinct.",

        "context": "In the lavish surroundings of a luxury restaurant, Renee's life was cut brutally short by barbed wire; now, Detective Winston must unravel the tangled suspects, Claire, a non‑binary individual, and Isla.\n \n\n Detective Winston had already had a long day, sifting through files, fieldwork, and witness narratives, who mostly tended to exaggerate details. As his long evening unfolded, he was parked outside a well-lit room; light emanating from a window. This was Claire's room, which her neighbor distinctly mentioned lights up late into the night when Claire is at her computer. \n \n\n According her neighbor and to her own roommate, Claire is one who never leaves her room whenever she engages in her internet activities, a detail that struck the detective as particularly strange. \n \n\n Claire, who happened to be a secretary by day and a waitress at a local restaurant by night, had been on Winston's radar since the case was assigned to him. The restaurant was also coincidentally the murder scene.\n \n\n As Winston approached her front door, he couldn't help but notice the enclosed garden, embellished with a line of barbed wire for added security. It was an unusual choice of boundary protection for a garden, but it held a surreal beauty in the moonlight. \n \n\n \"Claire's gardening was a hobby she fancied in her free time,\" a neighbor once mentioned, adding that she was adept at handling the barbing without ever having an injury, a skill that had surprised many.\n \n\n In their brief conversation, her roommate had mentioned the elusive yet frequent late-hour typing noises coming from her room and how suddenly they would stop whenever she tried to enter.\n \n\n \"I always found it strange. She would immediately shut her laptop, and I didn't really see what she was working so late into the night. It wasn't like her,\" the roommate remarked. \n \n\n \"All these late-night activities don't necessarily mean any harm,\" Winston murmured to himself.\n \n\n As the evening progressed, Winston found out from the restaurant's janitor that there was ongoing construction by the restaurant. The presence of the surplus barbed wire stockpile meant that it was a common sight in their vicinity.\n \n\n Renee, the victim, was more to Claire than just an overseer at the restaurant. Renee, amidst her work, had unexpectedly stumbled upon Claire's illegal embezzlement activities linked to the restaurant's funds. Word was, she was about to expose these allegations, which would have undoubtedly cost Claire her job and possibly lead to incarceration.\n \n\n As Winston drove back, battling an oncoming headache, he lit up a cigarette. The day had been long, crammed with ongoing conversations filled with facts and stories. As he watched the ember crush under his boot, his instincts whispered that there was a long path ahead before he could find resolution.\n \n\n Winston sat down at his desk, shuffling through the case files. The file named 'Renee' seemed to be the one that took his interest. He pulled out the notes from the coroner's office; Renee had been found some time earlier at the two-Michelin-starred L'etoile Restaurant.\n \n\n Shrugging on his coat, Winston walked toward the door, picking up the file enroute. He hailed a cab and slipped the driver an address halfway across town; the scene of the murder - a now-closed luxury restaurant.\n \n\n Inside, a crowd had made the regular police's work a little more difficult. Separating potential suspects from huddling, shocked patrons was decidedly hard. \n \n\n Winston walked up to a uniformed officer and learnt from him that a crowd of people were dining at the restaurant when the crime was committed; among them was a woman named Isla.\n \n\n A trip to her house later, Winston found himself in front of a woman with an achingly passionate love for her favorite music group. He couldn't help but notice a collection of survival tools on a nearby rack reflecting the afternoon sunlight. As he browsed, he found several open tabs on her computer that linked to various tutorials and forums about survival skills. It was known to him, from a previous informant, that Isla had been learning survival skills through those online sources. He remembered learning earlier that Isla had defended her home against an intruder with a piece of barbed wire once.\n \n\n As he was about to leave, he noticed a receipt on the coffee table. It was from a local hardware store barely a day old and listed 'barbed wire' as one of the items.\n \n\n Isla showed Winston out of the house, all the while talking passionately about her favorite music group. They were up for the same award that Renee's group ultimately won. \"It ain't fair, you know?\" she complained. \"My boys deserved it, not them.\"\n \n\n A canvas of previous police reports showed that she had been in a couple of discrimination lawsuits. Neighbors had heard her speak poorly of Renee's culture.\n \n\n Winston made his way back to L'etoile Restaurant. The manager handed him the reservations book. Renee had booked a table for the night of her death. Not far from her entry was another name that seemed all too familiar - Isla.",

        "context": "In the deafening silence of an unexpectedly deserted fitness center, Detective Winston finds himself staring at a chilling scene - Isaac's lifeless body riddled with shotgun pellets, leaving Milton and Alice, a proudly non‑binary person, as his primary suspects.\n \n\n The late night rain splattered against the dimly lit street as Winston parked his car outside the bustling fitness center. The old dusty building sat in the middle of downtown, open 24 hours to cater to the city-life fitness enthusiasts. The 24-hour timing of the gym provided Isaac a place to be when he was working late. It also afforded Milton, the alleged tax evader and the building owner, numerous opportunities to encounter Isaac.\n \n\n For years Winston had known about the gym, a small struggling space owned and operated by Isaac, an IRS agent turned yoga instructor, who had been found dead there the previous night - shot dead with what appeared to be a shotgun. Isaac, with his whistleblowing nature, had recently acquired extensive evidence on a tax evasion scheme. This scheme was alleged to be run by none other than Milton.\n \n\n Winston spotted Milton, the robust man in his sixties and owner of the building, emerging from the fitness center. An overcast of suspicion hung over Milton as he owned several other buildings in the area, all implicated in his alleged tax evasion scandal.\n \n\n Revealing his badge, Winston introduced himself, \"Detective Winston. I'd like to ask a few questions.\" Milton, nonchalant as always, simply answered, \"About Isaac?\"\n \n\n \"Yeah... You knew him well?\"\n \n\n Milton adjusted the strap of his shotgun before answering, \"He was a tenant. That's all.\"\n \n\n Winston furrowed his brows, \"That shotgun - it's legal!\"\n \n\n \"Indeed,\" Milton declared, \"I even passed the required training course. The local authorities granted me a license.\"\n \n\n Winston's eyes darted to the keys in the man's hand, \"I see you also have keys to the gym.\"\n \n\n \"It's my property, Detective,\" Milton responded dismissively.\n \n\n Winston sighed, unfazed by Milton's audacity, \"It's undisputed that the gym is never locked yet Isaac was alone last night. He had potential evidence that could have sent you to prison, Milton.\"\n \n\n \"So?\" Milton's face revealed no fear and no hint of adversity.\n \n\n This reaction gnawed at Winston as he returned to his car. Thoughts of Isaac's murder - the shotgun wound matching the one Milton regularly carried, Milton's unfazed demeanor despite the possible charges, and Milton's evident firearms training - swarmed his mind. As he mulled over these facts, he made a mental note to delve deeper into Isaac's evidence - the potential key to exposing Milton's illicit activities and ensuring justice.\n \n\n Winston squinted his eyes, scanning the familiar hustle and bustle of the fitness center. The crime scene of Isaac's murder was abnormal, the contrast of violence against the backdrop of health and vitality. \n \n\n Dodging a stray basketball, he made his way to the bench where Alice and Isaac used to workout together regularly. Alice had a spotless record with the fitness center - seemed she had never missed a month of membership dues.\n \n\n As he advanced, he remembered a fact shared by Alice's friends. They had alluded to how Alice sneakily mentioned fight club every Tuesday night, a pattern they had quickly noticed.\n \n\n Spotting the middle-aged woman, he strode toward Alice. Her movements were graceful as she pulled down the levels, her muscles contracting with every repetition. She had been in the military, particularly in a special weapons unit where her training with shotguns had given her an edge. Her fitness regime bore witness to that, and she knew her way around weapons- the shotgun she recently purchased was just a testament to that.\n \n\n \"Hello Alice,\" he initiated the conversation. He knew patience was key in such delicate interrogations, especially with suspects like Alice.\n \n\n \"Oh, Winston, what an unexpected surprise!\" Alice's face lit up with genuine surprise, her eyes shifting to the shotgun propped at the corner of the bench, its presence undeniable.\n \n\n Discarding any pleasantries, Winston moved to the crux of the matter. \"Isaac trained right here didn’t he, you guys used to train together?\"\n \n\n Alice gave a small nod, memories flickering in her eyes. Winston observed her, recognizing a trace of melancholy. Alice’s dulcet voice broke the silence. \"Yes...we had a sort of routine together.\"\n \n\n He glanced at her bruised knuckles appreciatively, a new patch of purple catching his attention. Her friends had mentioned Alice's weekly fight club rendezvous every Tuesday night. The tough soldier, habituated to the brutality of the fight club, would invariably return home every Wednesday morning nursing fresh battle sores.\n \n\n Alice was a puzzle piece in a complex jigsaw puzzle. An aunt, a loyal fitness center member, a fighter, and undoubtedly an experienced shotgun user due to her military background. Her every Tuesday night fights stood out starkly against her normal routine. She was a conundrum tightly bound by her routine, fitness center membership, military background, and her recent shotgun purchase.\n \n\n \"You know Winston...Isaac was the only family I had left,\" Alice mused, her thoughts clearly going down a memory lane, her fingers tracing her recent shotgun casually. The shotgun she had recently purchased was now in her possession. With these words, she abruptly stood up, signaled the trainer for her next routine, leaving Winston to join the dots of the puzzle she represented in this murder mystery.",

Remnants of police tape lingered in corners, while somber-touches reminders of what had happened to Isaac still hung in the air.\n \n\n He was here to interview Milton, a well-known landlord in the vicinity and interestingly enough, an aficionado of funeral practices. As a testament to the latter, he often locked himself away to watch documentaries about funeral practices, a behavior reported by several tenants. Milton's fascination was no secret.\n \n\n Winston stepped into Milton's office, spotting a wall lined with framed contents. Among them was a gun license, recently issued by the local authorities - a fitting addition, given that Milton had passed all mandatory firearms training courses.\n \n\n Oddly enough, Milton was seated behind his desk clad in a sharp, well-cut black suit. This wasn't out of character though; this was a man known for appearing overdressed for simple occasions. In fact, a tenant had once mentioned that Milton regularly shops for coats and ties at funeral shops.\n \n\n Winston spotted a shotgun in a corner, a disturbing sight considering it was the same type specified in the coroner's report for Isaac's death. It was an intriguing piece of evidence, considering Milton owns the shotgun.\n \n\n Their conversation veered into various topics, with Milton highlighting his passion for reading. His bookshelf was lined with an extensive collection of books on death rituals from around the world - yet another proof of his peculiar interests. \n \n\n In the midst of their conversation, Isaac's name came up. Following reliable sources, Winston knew something crucial - Isaac had stumbled upon evidence directly implicating Milton in a tax evasion scheme. Isaac, the ever-vigilant whistleblower, was preparing to expose Milton's scandalous scheme - a revelation that could land Milton in prison.\n \n\n As Winston left the fitness center, he pondered on his findings. Milton's tax evasion scheme, his interest in funeral practices, the shotgun license, the matching murder weapon... it all seemed to connect. He was confident that the tax evasion evidence would be enough to send Milton to jail, but for now, only time would tell. It was just another day on the job for Winston. As for Milton, his fate hung in the balance.\n \n\n Detective Winston studied the scene: shattered glass, blood splatter, and scattered workout equipment telling a silent story. The fitness center wasn't the usual type of crime scene he found himself in. He sighed deeply and headed over to his prime suspect: Alice.\n \n\n Alice was just a stone's throw away from the crime scene. Staring blankly with pale, emotionless eyes. In her hand, a shotgun; paperwork indicating a fresh purchase tucked within its case, valid purchase documents all checked out at the base.\n \n\n Winston approached Alice cautiously and asked, \"You know Isaac's workout routine, correct? The list of Isaac's routines you've given us earlier... it matches the information we gathered. You both were here all the time.\" \n \n\n Shocked by the sudden personal query, Alice confessed, \"We workout together, Winston. At least... we used to.\"\n \n\n Winston's eyes flickered to the shotgun slackly rested in Alice's lap. \"Been a while since I've seen a lady with a new piece like this.\"\n \n\n Alice was quick to correct him, \"Not to boast, Winston, but I've been handling such arms ever since my military days.\"\n \n\n Despite the grim predicament, Winston could tell Alice was trying to be cooperative. She was calm, composed; despite the whole flare-up. He moved on to the next line of questioning, \"Your son... he interacted often with Isaac?\"\n \n\n Alice appeared apprehensive before finally admitting, \"Recently, yes... He told me Isaac threatened him. Isaac... he acted aggressively towards my boy often.\"\n \n\n \"Interesting,\" Winston stammered, not wanting to press Alice too hard. He asked a softer question to lighten the mood, \"You often workout together then?\"\n \n\n Alice looked surprised and retorted mockingly, \"Is it that weird? We were the members of the same fitness center after all.\"\n \n\n Before Winston could continue his questioning, he was handed a document by one of his officers. It read Isaac’s name and the note of a restraining order filed against him by a previous ex-partner. It seemed complicating factors always came in multiples in cases such as this.\n \n\n Without keeping Alice in the dark, he disclosed the information with her, “A restraining order, and a school expulsion due to fighting incidents... Isaac seemed to have some rough patches in the past, huh?”\n \n\n Alice turned her head and acknowledged Winston's statement with a slight nod, her lips sealed shut.\n \n\n Winston wasn't sure why, but he felt the need to reassure her and said, \"We're in this together, Alice. We'll figure it out. If Isaac was threatening your son, then we can't overlook any facet of the situation.\"\n \n\n Seeing Alice with a newly purchased shotgun in her possession and catching onto bits of their relationship, Winston tried to figure out the puzzle, leaving no stone unturned. The interview with Alice wasn't offering any easy solutions, but Winston knew the case was anything but such.",

Milton:\n   - Motive: Isaac had discovered evidence implicating Milton in a tax evasion scheme, which could lead to Milton's imprisonment.\n   - Means: Milton owns a shotgun, the same type specified in the coroner's report for Isaac's death, and has a valid gun license.\n   - Opportunity: Milton was present at the fitness center, and the crime scene was in close proximity to his office.\n\n2. Alice:\n   - Motive: Isaac had threatened Alice's son, and there was a history of aggression towards him.\n   - Means: Alice has a newly purchased shotgun, and she has experience handling firearms from her military days.\n   - Opportunity: Alice was at the fitness center at the time of the crime, and her proximity to the crime scene is established.\n\nComparing the two suspects, both Milton and Alice have motive, means, and opportunity. However, the motive for Milton seems more direct and concrete, as the tax evasion scheme could lead to severe legal consequences. On the other hand, Alice's motive is based on the threat to her son, which might be considered less compelling.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it appears that Milton is the more likely suspect in Isaac's murder. However, it's essential to remember that this is an incomplete investigation, and further evidence may change the course of the case.\n\nANSWER: 1 - Milton.",
